/**
 * A Discretized Stream (DStream), the basic abstraction in Spark Streaming, is a continuous
 * sequence of RDDs (of the same type) representing a continuous stream of data (see
 * org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD in the Spark core documentation for more details on RDDs).
 * DStreams can either be created from live data (such as, data from TCP sockets, Kafka, Flume,
 * etc.) using a [[org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext]] or it can be generated by
 * transforming existing DStreams using operations such as `map`,
 * `window` and `reduceByKeyAndWindow`. While a Spark Streaming program is running, each DStream
 * periodically generates a RDD, either from live data or by transforming the RDD generated by a
 * parent DStream.
 *
 * This class contains the basic operations available on all DStreams, such as `map`, `filter` and
 * `window`. In addition, [[org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.PairDStreamFunctions]] contains
 * operations available only on DStreams of key-value pairs, such as `groupByKeyAndWindow` and
 * `join`. These operations are automatically available on any DStream of pairs
 * (e.g., DStream[(Int, Int)] through implicit conversions.
 *
 * DStreams internally is characterized by a few basic properties:
 *  - A list of other DStreams that the DStream depends on
 *  - A time interval at which the DStream generates an RDD
 *  - A function that is used to generate an RDD after each time interval
