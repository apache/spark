/**
 * A general, named code block representing an operation that instantiates RDDs.

 * Examples include, but will not be limited to, existing RDD operations, such as textFile,
 * reduceByKey, and treeAggregate.

 * An operation scope may be nested in other scopes. For instance, a SQL query may enclose
 * scopes associated with the public RDD APIs it uses under the hood.
 *
 * There is no particular relationship between an operation scope and a stage or a job.
 * A scope may live inside one stage (e.g. map) or span across multiple jobs (e.g. take).
