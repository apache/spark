/**
 * A task resource request. This is used in conjunction with the [[ResourceProfile]] to
 * programmatically specify the resources needed for an RDD that will be applied at the
 * stage level.
 *
 * Use [[TaskResourceRequests]] class as a convenience API.
 *
 * @param resourceName Resource name
 * @param amount Amount requesting as a Double to support fractional resource requests.
 *               Valid values are less than or equal to 1.0 or whole numbers. This essentially
 *               lets you configure X number of tasks to run on a single resource,
 *               ie amount equals 0.5 translates into 2 tasks per resource address.
