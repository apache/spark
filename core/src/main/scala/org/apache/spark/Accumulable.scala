/**
 * A data type that can be accumulated, ie has an commutative and associative "add" operation,
 * but where the result type, `R`, may be different from the element type being added, `T`.
 *
 * You must define how to add data, and how to merge two of these together.  For some data types,
 * such as a counter, these might be the same operation. In that case, you can use the simpler
 * [[org.apache.spark.Accumulator]]. They won't always be the same, though -- e.g., imagine you are
 * accumulating a set. You will add items to the set, and you will union two sets together.
 *
 * @param initialValue initial value of accumulator
 * @param param helper object defining how to add elements of type `R` and `T`
 * @param name human-readable name for use in Spark's web UI
 * @param internal if this [[Accumulable]] is internal. Internal [[Accumulable]]s will be reported
 *                 to the driver via heartbeats. For internal [[Accumulable]]s, `R` must be
 *                 thread safe so that they can be reported correctly.
 * @tparam R the full accumulated data (result type)
 * @tparam T partial data that can be added in
