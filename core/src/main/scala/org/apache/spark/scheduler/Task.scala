/**
 * A unit of execution. We have two kinds of Task's in Spark:
 * - [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask]]
 * - [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask]]
 *
 * A Spark job consists of one or more stages. The very last stage in a job consists of multiple
 * ResultTasks, while earlier stages consist of ShuffleMapTasks. A ResultTask executes the task
 * and sends the task output back to the driver application. A ShuffleMapTask executes the task
 * and divides the task output to multiple buckets (based on the task's partitioner).
 *
 * @param stageId id of the stage this task belongs to
 * @param partitionId index of the number in the RDD
