/**
 * Schedules the tasks within a single TaskSet in the TaskSchedulerImpl. This class keeps track of
 * each task, retries tasks if they fail (up to a limited number of times), and
 * handles locality-aware scheduling for this TaskSet via delay scheduling. The main interfaces
 * to it are resourceOffer, which asks the TaskSet whether it wants to run a task on one node,
 * and handleSuccessfulTask/handleFailedTask, which tells it that one of its tasks changed state
 *  (e.g. finished/failed).
 *
 * THREADING: This class is designed to only be called from code with a lock on the
 * TaskScheduler (e.g. its event handlers). It should not be called from other threads.
