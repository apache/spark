/**
 * Allows Master to persist any state that is necessary in order to recover from a failure.
 * The following semantics are required:
 *   - addApplication and addWorker are called before completing registration of a new app/worker.
 *   - removeApplication and removeWorker are called at any time.
 * Given these two requirements, we will have all apps and workers persisted, but
 * we might not have yet deleted apps or workers that finished (so their liveness must be verified
 * during recovery).
 *
 * The implementation of this trait defines how name-object pairs are stored or retrieved.
