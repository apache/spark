This is an assembly module for Spark project.

It creates a single tar.gz file that includes all needed dependency of the project.

If you need to build an assembly for a different version of Hadoop the
hadoop-version system property needs to be set as in this example:
  -Dhadoop.version=2.0.6-alpha
