This is an assembly module for Spark project.

It creates a single tar.gz file that includes all needed dependency of the project
except for org.apache.hadoop.* jars that are supposed to be available from the
deployed Hadoop cluster.

This module is off by default. To activate it specify the profile in the command line
  -Pbigtop-dist

If you need to build an assembly for a different version of Hadoop the
hadoop-version system property needs to be set as in this example:
  -Dhadoop.version=3.4.1
