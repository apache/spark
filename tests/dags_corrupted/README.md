# Unit Tests DAGs Folder

This folder contains DAGs for Airflow unit testing. These files contain defects that prevent the default 
Python interpreter from loading this file

To access a DAG in this folder, use the following code inside a unit test.

```python
TEST_DAG_FOLDER = os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'dags_corrupted')

dagbag = DagBag(dag_folder=TEST_DAG_FOLDER)
dag = dagbag.get_dag(dag_id)
```
