# We need to explicitly clear the warning registry context
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html
# One thing to be aware of is that if a warning has already been raised because
# of a once/default rule, then no matter what filters are set the warning will
# not be seen again unless the warnings registry related to the warning has
# been cleared.
#
# Proposed fix from Stack overflow, which refers to the Python bug-page
# noqa
