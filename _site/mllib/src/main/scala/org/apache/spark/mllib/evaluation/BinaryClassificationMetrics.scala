/**
 * :: Experimental ::
 * Evaluator for binary classification.
 *
 * @param scoreAndLabels an RDD of (score, label) pairs.
 * @param numBins if greater than 0, then the curves (ROC curve, PR curve) computed internally
 *                will be down-sampled to this many "bins". If 0, no down-sampling will occur.
 *                This is useful because the curve contains a point for each distinct score
 *                in the input, and this could be as large as the input itself -- millions of
 *                points or more, when thousands may be entirely sufficient to summarize
 *                the curve. After down-sampling, the curves will instead be made of approximately
 *                `numBins` points instead. Points are made from bins of equal numbers of
 *                consecutive points. The size of each bin is
 *                `floor(scoreAndLabels.count() / numBins)`, which means the resulting number
 *                of bins may not exactly equal numBins. The last bin in each partition may
 *                be smaller as a result, meaning there may be an extra sample at
 *                partition boundaries.
