    Downloads a file from Google Cloud Storage.

    If a filename is supplied, it writes the file to the specified location, alternatively one can
    set the ``store_to_xcom_key`` parameter to True push the file content into xcom. When the file size
    exceeds the maximum size for xcom it is recommended to write to a file.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator`

    :param bucket: The Google Cloud Storage bucket where the object is.
        Must not contain 'gs://' prefix. (templated)
    :type bucket: str
    :param object: The name of the object to download in the Google cloud
        storage bucket. (templated)
    :type object: str
    :param filename: The file path, including filename,  on the local file system (where the
        operator is being executed) that the file should be downloaded to. (templated)
        If no filename passed, the downloaded data will not be stored on the local file
        system.
    :type filename: str
    :param store_to_xcom_key: If this param is set, the operator will push
        the contents of the downloaded file to XCom with the key set in this
        parameter. If not set, the downloaded data will not be pushed to XCom. (templated)
    :type store_to_xcom_key: str
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud Platform.
    :type gcp_conn_id: str
    :param google_cloud_storage_conn_id: (Deprecated) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud
        Platform. This parameter has been deprecated. You should pass the gcp_conn_id parameter instead.
    :type google_cloud_storage_conn_id: str
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate, if any.
        For this to work, the service account making the request must have
        domain-wide delegation enabled.
