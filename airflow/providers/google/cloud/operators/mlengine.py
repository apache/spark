    Start a Google Cloud ML Engine prediction job.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:MLEngineStartBatchPredictionJobOperator`

    NOTE: For model origin, users should consider exactly one from the
    three options below:

    1. Populate ``uri`` field only, which should be a GCS location that
       points to a tensorflow savedModel directory.
    2. Populate ``model_name`` field only, which refers to an existing
       model, and the default version of the model will be used.
    3. Populate both ``model_name`` and ``version_name`` fields, which
       refers to a specific version of a specific model.

    In options 2 and 3, both model and version name should contain the
    minimal identifier. For instance, call::

        MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator(
            ...,
            model_name='my_model',
            version_name='my_version',
            ...)

    if the desired model version is
    ``projects/my_project/models/my_model/versions/my_version``.

    See https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs
    for further documentation on the parameters.
