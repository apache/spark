* ``Updated GoogleAdsHook to support newer API versions after google deprecated v5. Google Ads v8 is the new default API. (#17111)``
* ``Google Ads Hook: Support newer versions of the google-ads library (#17160)``

.. warning:: The underlying google-ads library had breaking changes.

   Previously the google ads library returned data as native protobuf messages. Now it returns data as proto-plus objects that behave more like conventional Python objects.

   To preserve compatibility the hook's ``search()`` converts the data back to native protobuf before returning it. Your existing operators *should* work as before, but due to the urgency of the v5 API being deprecated it was not tested too thoroughly. Therefore you should carefully evaluate your operator and hook functionality with this new version.

   In order to use the API's new proto-plus format, you can use the ``search_proto_plus()`` method.

   For more information, please consult `google-ads migration document <https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/library-version-10>`__:

Change in ``AutoMLPredictOperator``
```````````````````````````````````

The ``params`` parameter in ``airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.automl.AutoMLPredictOperator`` class
was renamed ``operation_params`` because it conflicted with a ``param`` parameter in the ``BaseOperator`` class.

Integration with the ``apache.beam`` provider
`````````````````````````````````````````````

In 3.0.0 version of the provider we've changed the way of integrating with the ``apache.beam`` provider.
The previous versions of both providers caused conflicts when trying to install them together
using PIP > 20.2.4. The conflict is not detected by PIP 20.2.4 and below but it was there and
the version of ``Google BigQuery`` python client was not matching on both sides. As the result, when
both ``apache.beam`` and ``google`` provider were installed, some features of the ``BigQuery`` operators
might not work properly. This was cause by ``apache-beam`` client not yet supporting the new google
python clients when ``apache-beam[gcp]`` extra was used. The ``apache-beam[gcp]`` extra is used
by ``Dataflow`` operators and while they might work with the newer version of the ``Google BigQuery``
python client, it is not guaranteed.

This version introduces additional extra requirement for the ``apache.beam`` extra of the ``google`` provider
and symmetrically the additional requirement for the ``google`` extra of the ``apache.beam`` provider.
Both ``google`` and ``apache.beam`` provider do not use those extras by default, but you can specify
them when installing the providers. The consequence of that is that some functionality of the ``Dataflow``
operators might not be available.

Unfortunately the only ``complete`` solution to the problem is for the ``apache.beam`` to migrate to the
new (>=2.0.0) Google Python clients.

This is the extra for the ``google`` provider:

.. code-block:: python

        extras_require = (
            {
                # ...
                "apache.beam": ["apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam", "apache-beam[gcp]"],
                # ...
            },
        )

And likewise this is the extra for the ``apache.beam`` provider:

.. code-block:: python

        extras_require = ({"google": ["apache-airflow-providers-google", "apache-beam[gcp]"]},)

You can still run this with PIP version <= 20.2.4 and go back to the previous behaviour:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install apache-airflow-providers-google[apache.beam]

or

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam[google]

But be aware that some ``BigQuery`` operators functionality might not be available in this case.

Updated ``google-cloud-*`` libraries
````````````````````````````````````

This release of the provider package contains third-party library updates, which may require updating your
DAG files or custom hooks and operators, if you were using objects from those libraries.
Updating of these libraries is necessary to be able to use new features made available by new versions of
the libraries and to obtain bug fixes that are only available for new versions of the library.

Details are covered in the UPDATING.md files for each library, but there are some details
that you should pay attention to.

The field names use the snake_case convention
`````````````````````````````````````````````

If your DAG uses an object from the above mentioned libraries passed by XCom, it is necessary to update the
naming convention of the fields that are read. Previously, the fields used the CamelSnake convention,
now the snake_case convention is used.

**Before:**

.. code-block:: python

    set_acl_permission = GCSBucketCreateAclEntryOperator(
        task_id="gcs-set-acl-permission",
        bucket=BUCKET_NAME,
        entity="user-{{ task_instance.xcom_pull('get-instance')['persistenceIamIdentity']"
        ".split(':', 2)[1] }}",
        role="OWNER",
    )


**After:**

.. code-block:: python

    set_acl_permission = GCSBucketCreateAclEntryOperator(
        task_id="gcs-set-acl-permission",
        bucket=BUCKET_NAME,
        entity="user-{{ task_instance.xcom_pull('get-instance')['persistence_iam_identity']"
        ".split(':', 2)[1] }}",
        role="OWNER",
    )
