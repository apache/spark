    This operator allows you to post alerts to Opsgenie.
    Accepts a connection that has an Opsgenie API key as the connection's password.
    This operator sets the domain to conn_id.host, and if not set will default
    to ``https://api.opsgenie.com``.

    Each Opsgenie API key can be pre-configured to a team integration.
    You can override these defaults in this operator.
