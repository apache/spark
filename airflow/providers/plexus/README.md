## Provider package

This is a provider package for `plexus` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in `airflow.providers.plexus` python package.



## Installation

NOTE!

On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might leads to errors in installation - depends on your choice
of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
`pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
`--use-deprecated legacy-resolver` to your pip install command.

You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
`pip install apache-airflow-providers-plexus`
