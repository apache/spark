Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.

* ``Replace DockerOperator's 'volumes' arg for 'mounts' (#15843)``

The ``volumes`` parameter in
``airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker.DockerOperator`` and
``airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker_swarm.DockerSwarmOperator``
was replaced by the ``mounts`` parameter, which uses the newer
`mount syntax <https://docs.docker.com/storage/>`__ instead of ``--bind``.
