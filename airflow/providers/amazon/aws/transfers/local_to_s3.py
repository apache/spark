class LocalFilesystemToS3Operator(BaseOperator):
    """
    Uploads a file from a local filesystem to Amazon S3.

    :param filename: Path to the local file. Path can be either absolute
            (e.g. /path/to/file.ext) or relative (e.g. ../../foo/*/*.csv). (templated)
    :param dest_key: The key of the object to copy to. (templated)

        It can be either full s3:// style url or relative path from root level.

        When it's specified as a full s3:// url, including dest_bucket results in a TypeError.
    :param dest_bucket: Name of the S3 bucket to where the object is copied. (templated)

        Inclusion when `dest_key` is provided as a full s3:// url results in a TypeError.
    :param aws_conn_id: Connection id of the S3 connection to use
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.

        You can provide the following values:

        - False: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used,
                 but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - path/to/cert/bundle.pem: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
    :param replace: A flag to decide whether or not to overwrite the key
            if it already exists. If replace is False and the key exists, an
            error will be raised.
    :param encrypt: If True, the file will be encrypted on the server-side
        by S3 and will be stored in an encrypted form while at rest in S3.
    :param gzip: If True, the file will be compressed locally
    :param acl_policy: String specifying the canned ACL policy for the file being
        uploaded to the S3 bucket.
