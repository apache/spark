    """
    This operator enables the transfer of files from a FTP server to S3. It can be used to
    transfer one or multiple files.

    :param ftp_path: The ftp remote path. For one file it is mandatory to include the file as well.
        For multiple files, it is the route where the files will be found.
    :param s3_bucket: The targeted s3 bucket in which to upload the file(s).
    :param s3_key: The targeted s3 key. For one file it must include the file path. For several,
        it must end with "/".
    :param ftp_filenames: Only used if you want to move multiple files. You can pass a list
        with exact filenames present in the ftp path, or a prefix that all files must meet. It
        can also be the string '*' for moving all the files within the ftp path.
    :param s3_filenames: Only used if you want to move multiple files and name them different from
        the originals from the ftp. It can be a list of filenames or file prefix (that will replace
        the ftp prefix).
    :param ftp_conn_id: The ftp connection id. The name or identifier for
        establishing a connection to the FTP server.
    :param aws_conn_id: The s3 connection id. The name or identifier for
        establishing a connection to S3.
    :param replace: A flag to decide whether or not to overwrite the key
        if it already exists. If replace is False and the key exists, an
        error will be raised.
    :param encrypt: If True, the file will be encrypted on the server-side
        by S3 and will be stored in an encrypted form while at rest in S3.
    :param gzip: If True, the file will be compressed locally
    :param acl_policy: String specifying the canned ACL policy for the file being
        uploaded to the S3 bucket.
