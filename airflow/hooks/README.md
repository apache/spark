# Airflow Hooks

Airflow Hooks are interfaces to external platforms and databases. They implement a common interface and act as building blocks for operators.

The hooks contained within this directory are core Airflow hooks from which others may inherit, including the modules distributed in provider packages. They are included by default in any Airflow implementation.
