class BashOperator(BaseOperator):
    r"""
    Execute a Bash script, command or set of commands.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:BashOperator`

    If BaseOperator.do_xcom_push is True, the last line written to stdout
    will also be pushed to an XCom when the bash command completes

    :param bash_command: The command, set of commands or reference to a
        bash script (must be '.sh') to be executed. (templated)
    :type bash_command: str
    :param env: If env is not None, it must be a dict that defines the
        environment variables for the new process; these are used instead
        of inheriting the current process environment, which is the default
        behavior. (templated)
    :type env: dict
    :param output_encoding: Output encoding of bash command
    :type output_encoding: str
    :param skip_exit_code: If task exits with this exit code, leave the task
        in ``skipped`` state (default: 99). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
        exit code will be treated as a failure.
    :type skip_exit_code: int

    Airflow will evaluate the exit code of the bash command. In general, a non-zero exit code will result in
    task failure and zero will result in task success. Exit code ``99`` (or another set in ``skip_exit_code``)
    will throw an :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowSkipException`, which will leave the task in ``skipped``
    state. You can have all non-zero exit codes be treated as a failure by setting ``skip_exit_code=None``.

    .. list-table::
       :widths: 25 25
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Exit code
         - Behavior
       * - 0
         - success
       * - `skip_exit_code` (default: 99)
         - raise :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowSkipException`
       * - otherwise
         - raise :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowException`

    .. note::

        Airflow will not recognize a non-zero exit code unless the whole shell exit with a non-zero exit
        code.  This can be an issue if the non-zero exit arises from a sub-command.  The easiest way of
        addressing this is to prefix the command with ``set -e;``

        Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            bash_command = "set -e; python3 script.py '{{ next_execution_date }}'"

    .. note::

        Add a space after the script name when directly calling a ``.sh`` script with the
        ``bash_command`` argument -- for example ``bash_command="my_script.sh "``.  This
        is because Airflow tries to apply load this file and process it as a Jinja template to
        it ends with ``.sh``, which will likely not be what most users want.

    .. warning::

        Care should be taken with "user" input or when using Jinja templates in the
        ``bash_command``, as this bash operator does not perform any escaping or
        sanitization of the command.

        This applies mostly to using "dag_run" conf, as that can be submitted via
        users in the Web UI. Most of the default template variables are not at
        risk.

    For example, do **not** do this:

    .. code-block:: python

        bash_task = BashOperator(
            task_id="bash_task",
            bash_command='echo "Here is the message: \'{{ dag_run.conf["message"] if dag_run else "" }}\'"',
        )

    Instead, you should pass this via the ``env`` kwarg and use double-quotes
    inside the bash_command, as below:

    .. code-block:: python

        bash_task = BashOperator(
            task_id="bash_task",
            bash_command='echo "here is the message: \'$message\'"',
            env={'message': '{{ dag_run.conf["message"] if dag_run else "" }}'},
        )
