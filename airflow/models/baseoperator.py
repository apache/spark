    """
    Abstract base class for all operators. Since operators create objects that
    become nodes in the dag, BaseOperator contains many recursive methods for
    dag crawling behavior. To derive this class, you are expected to override
    the constructor as well as the 'execute' method.

    Operators derived from this class should perform or trigger certain tasks
    synchronously (wait for completion). Example of operators could be an
    operator that runs a Pig job (PigOperator), a sensor operator that
    waits for a partition to land in Hive (HiveSensorOperator), or one that
    moves data from Hive to MySQL (Hive2MySqlOperator). Instances of these
    operators (tasks) target specific operations, running specific scripts,
    functions or data transfers.

    This class is abstract and shouldn't be instantiated. Instantiating a
    class derived from this one results in the creation of a task object,
    which ultimately becomes a node in DAG objects. Task dependencies should
    be set by using the set_upstream and/or set_downstream methods.

    :param task_id: a unique, meaningful id for the task
    :type task_id: str
    :param owner: the owner of the task, using the unix username is recommended
    :type owner: str
    :param email: the 'to' email address(es) used in email alerts. This can be a
        single email or multiple ones. Multiple addresses can be specified as a
        comma or semi-colon separated string or by passing a list of strings.
    :type email: str or list[str]
    :param email_on_retry: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when a
        task is retried
    :type email_on_retry: bool
    :param email_on_failure: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when
        a task failed
    :type email_on_failure: bool
    :param retries: the number of retries that should be performed before
        failing the task
    :type retries: int
    :param retry_delay: delay between retries
    :type retry_delay: datetime.timedelta
    :param retry_exponential_backoff: allow progressive longer waits between
        retries by using exponential backoff algorithm on retry delay (delay
        will be converted into seconds)
    :type retry_exponential_backoff: bool
    :param max_retry_delay: maximum delay interval between retries
    :type max_retry_delay: datetime.timedelta
    :param start_date: The ``start_date`` for the task, determines
        the ``execution_date`` for the first task instance. The best practice
        is to have the start_date rounded
        to your DAG's ``schedule_interval``. Daily jobs have their start_date
        some day at 00:00:00, hourly jobs have their start_date at 00:00
        of a specific hour. Note that Airflow simply looks at the latest
        ``execution_date`` and adds the ``schedule_interval`` to determine
        the next ``execution_date``. It is also very important
        to note that different tasks' dependencies
        need to line up in time. If task A depends on task B and their
        start_date are offset in a way that their execution_date don't line
        up, A's dependencies will never be met. If you are looking to delay
        a task, for example running a daily task at 2AM, look into the
        ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor``. We advise against using
        dynamic ``start_date`` and recommend using fixed ones. Read the
        FAQ entry about start_date for more information.
    :type start_date: datetime.datetime
    :param end_date: if specified, the scheduler won't go beyond this date
    :type end_date: datetime.datetime
    :param depends_on_past: when set to true, task instances will run
        sequentially and only if the previous instance has succeeded or has been skipped.
        The task instance for the start_date is allowed to run.
    :type depends_on_past: bool
    :param wait_for_downstream: when set to true, an instance of task
        X will wait for tasks immediately downstream of the previous instance
        of task X to finish successfully or be skipped before it runs. This is useful if the
        different instances of a task X alter the same asset, and this asset
        is used by tasks downstream of task X. Note that depends_on_past
        is forced to True wherever wait_for_downstream is used. Also note that
        only tasks *immediately* downstream of the previous task instance are waited
        for; the statuses of any tasks further downstream are ignored.
    :type wait_for_downstream: bool
    :param dag: a reference to the dag the task is attached to (if any)
    :type dag: airflow.models.DAG
    :param priority_weight: priority weight of this task against other task.
        This allows the executor to trigger higher priority tasks before
        others when things get backed up. Set priority_weight as a higher
        number for more important tasks.
    :type priority_weight: int
    :param weight_rule: weighting method used for the effective total
        priority weight of the task. Options are:
        ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream``
        When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the
        aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream
        tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively
        when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have
        multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to
        complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing
        downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the
        aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where
        downstream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more
        aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you
        have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete
        before starting upstream tasks of other dags.  When set to
        ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight``
        specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when
        you know exactly what priority weight each task should have.
        Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of
        significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large
        DAGS. Options can be set as string or using the constants defined in
        the static class ``airflow.utils.WeightRule``
    :type weight_rule: str
    :param queue: which queue to target when running this job. Not
        all executors implement queue management, the CeleryExecutor
        does support targeting specific queues.
    :type queue: str
    :param pool: the slot pool this task should run in, slot pools are a
        way to limit concurrency for certain tasks
    :type pool: str
    :param pool_slots: the number of pool slots this task should use (>= 1)
        Values less than 1 are not allowed.
    :type pool_slots: int
    :param sla: time by which the job is expected to succeed. Note that
        this represents the ``timedelta`` after the period is closed. For
        example if you set an SLA of 1 hour, the scheduler would send an email
        soon after 1:00AM on the ``2016-01-02`` if the ``2016-01-01`` instance
        has not succeeded yet.
        The scheduler pays special attention for jobs with an SLA and
        sends alert
        emails for sla misses. SLA misses are also recorded in the database
        for future reference. All tasks that share the same SLA time
        get bundled in a single email, sent soon after that time. SLA
        notification are sent once and only once for each task instance.
    :type sla: datetime.timedelta
    :param execution_timeout: max time allowed for the execution of
        this task instance, if it goes beyond it will raise and fail.
    :type execution_timeout: datetime.timedelta
    :param on_failure_callback: a function to be called when a task instance
        of this task fails. a context dictionary is passed as a single
        parameter to this function. Context contains references to related
        objects to the task instance and is documented under the macros
        section of the API.
    :type on_failure_callback: TaskStateChangeCallback
    :param on_execute_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed right before the task is executed.
    :type on_execute_callback: TaskStateChangeCallback
    :param on_retry_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed when retries occur.
    :type on_retry_callback: TaskStateChangeCallback
    :param on_success_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed when the task succeeds.
    :type on_success_callback: TaskStateChangeCallback
    :param trigger_rule: defines the rule by which dependencies are applied
        for the task to get triggered. Options are:
        ``{ all_success | all_failed | all_done | one_success |
        one_failed | none_failed | none_failed_or_skipped | none_skipped | dummy}``
        default is ``all_success``. Options can be set as string or
        using the constants defined in the static class
        ``airflow.utils.TriggerRule``
    :type trigger_rule: str
    :param resources: A map of resource parameter names (the argument names of the
        Resources constructor) to their values.
    :type resources: dict
    :param run_as_user: unix username to impersonate while running the task
    :type run_as_user: str
    :param task_concurrency: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
        runs across execution_dates
    :type task_concurrency: int
    :param executor_config: Additional task-level configuration parameters that are
        interpreted by a specific executor. Parameters are namespaced by the name of
        executor.

        **Example**: to run this task in a specific docker container through
        the KubernetesExecutor ::

            MyOperator(...,
                executor_config={
                    "KubernetesExecutor":
                        {"image": "myCustomDockerImage"}
                }
            )
