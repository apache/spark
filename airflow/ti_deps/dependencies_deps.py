# TODO(aoen): SCHEDULER_QUEUED_DEPS is not coupled to actual scheduling/execution

# this dependency to become outdated and incorrect. This coupling should be created
# (e.g. via a dag_deps analog of ti_deps that will be used in the scheduler code,
# or allow batch deps checks) to ensure that the logic here is equivalent to the logic
# in the scheduler.
# Right now there's one discrepancy between this context and how scheduler schedule tasks:
# Scheduler will check if the executor has the task instance--it is not possible
# to check the executor outside scheduler main process.

# Dependencies that need to be met for a given task instance to be set to 'queued' state
# by the scheduler.
# This context has more DEPs than RUNNING_DEPS, as we can have task triggered by
# components other than scheduler, e.g. webserver.
