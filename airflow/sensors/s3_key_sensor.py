    Waits for a key (a file-like instance on S3) to be present in a S3 bucket.
    S3 being a key/value it does not support folders. The path is just a key
    a resource.

    :param bucket_key: The key being waited on. Supports full s3:// style url
        or relative path from root level. When it's specified as a full s3://
        url, please leave bucket_name as `None`.
    :type bucket_key: str
    :param bucket_name: Name of the S3 bucket. Only needed when ``bucket_key``
        is not provided as a full s3:// url.
    :type bucket_name: str
    :param wildcard_match: whether the bucket_key should be interpreted as a
        Unix wildcard pattern
    :type wildcard_match: bool
    :param aws_conn_id: a reference to the s3 connection
    :type aws_conn_id: str
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
