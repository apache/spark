    This hook is a wrapper around the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job.
    It requires that the "spark-submit" binary is in the PATH or the spark-home is set
    in the extra on the connection.

    :type application: str
    :param conf: Arbitrary Spark configuration properties (templated)
    :type conf: dict
    :param conn_id: The connection id as configured in Airflow administration. When an
                    invalid connection_id is supplied, it will default to yarn.
    :type conn_id: str
    :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
                  comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.
                  For example, serialized objects. (templated)

                     driver and executor classpaths. (templated)
    :type packages: str
    :param exclude_packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to exclude
                             while resolving the dependencies provided in 'packages' (templated)
    :type exclude_packages: str

                         for the maven coordinates given with 'packages'
    :type repositories: str
    :param total_executor_cores: (Standalone & Mesos only) Total cores for all executors
                                 (Default: all the available cores on the worker)
    :type total_executor_cores: int
    :param executor_cores: (Standalone & YARN only) Number of cores per executor (Default: 2)
    :type executor_cores: int
    :param executor_memory: Memory per executor (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
    :type executor_memory: str
    :param driver_memory: Memory allocated to the driver (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
    :type driver_memory: str
    :param keytab: Full path to the file that contains the keytab (templated)
    :type keytab: str

    :type verbose: bool
    :param spark_binary: The command to use for spark submit.
