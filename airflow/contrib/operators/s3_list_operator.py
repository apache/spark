class S3ListOperator(BaseOperator):
    """
    List all objects from the bucket with the given string prefix in name.

    This operator returns a python list with the name of objects which can be
    used by `xcom` in the downstream task.

    :param bucket: The S3 bucket where to find the objects. (templated)
    :type bucket: string
    :param prefix: Prefix string to filters the objects whose name begin with
        such prefix. (templated)
    :type prefix: string
    :param delimiter: the delimiter marks key hierarchy. (templated)
    :type delimiter: string
    :param aws_conn_id: The connection ID to use when connecting to S3 storage.
    :type aws_conn_id: string
    :parame verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:
        - False: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - path/to/cert/bundle.pem: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
    :type verify: bool or str

    **Example**:
        The following operator would list all the files
        (excluding subfolders) from the S3
        ``customers/2018/04/`` key in the ``data`` bucket. ::
