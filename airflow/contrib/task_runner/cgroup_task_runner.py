    Runs the raw Airflow task in a cgroup that has containment for memory and
    cpu. It uses the resource requirements defined in the task to construct
    the settings for the cgroup.

    Cgroup must be mounted first otherwise CgroupTaskRunner
    will not be able to work.

    cgroup-bin Ubuntu package must be installed to use cgexec command.

    Note that this task runner will only work if the Airflow user has root privileges,
    e.g. if the airflow user is called `airflow` then the following entries (or an even
    less restrictive ones) are needed in the sudoers file (replacing
    /CGROUPS_FOLDER with your system's cgroups folder, e.g. '/sys/fs/cgroup/'):
