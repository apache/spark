# This stub exists to "fake" the Context class as a TypedDict to provide
# better typehint and editor support.
#
# Unfortunately 'conn', 'macros', 'var.json', and 'var.value' need to be
# annotated as Any and loose discoverability because we don't know what
# attributes are injected at runtime, and giving them a class would trigger
# undefined attribute errors from Mypy. Hopefully there will be a mechanism to
# declare "these are defined, but don't error if others are accessed" someday.
