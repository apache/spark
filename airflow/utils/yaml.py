"""Use libyaml for YAML dump/load operations where possible.

If libyaml is available we will use it -- it is significantly faster.

This module delegates all other properties to the yaml module, so it can be used as:

.. code-block:: python
    import airflow.utils.yaml as yaml

And then be used directly in place of the normal python module.
