     - Inside an Operator, when it's passed to TaskDeferred
     - Actively running in a trigger worker

    We use the same class for both situations, and rely on all Trigger classes
    to be able to return the (Airflow-JSON-encodable) arguments that will
    let them be re-instantiated elsewhere.

        Runs the trigger in an asynchronous context.

        The trigger should yield an Event whenever it wants to fire off
        an event, and return None if it is finished. Single-event triggers
        should thus yield and then immediately return.

        If it yields, it is likely that it will be resumed very quickly,
        but it may not be (e.g. if the workload is being moved to another
        triggerer process, or a multi-event trigger was being used for a
        single-event task defer).

        In either case, Trigger classes should assume they will be persisted,
        and then rely on cleanup() being called when they are no longer needed.
