===============
Testing PySpark
===============

In order to run PySpark tests, you should build Spark itself first via Maven or SBT. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    build/mvn -DskipTests clean package

.. code-block:: bash

    build/sbt -Phive clean package


After that, the PySpark test cases can be run via using ``python/run-tests``. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    python/run-tests --python-executable=python3

Note that you may set ``OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY`` environment variable to ``YES`` if you are running tests on Mac OS.

Please see the guidance on how to |building_spark|_,
`run tests for a module, or individual tests <https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html>`_.


Running Individual PySpark Tests
--------------------------------

You can run a specific test via using ``python/run-tests``, for example, as below:

.. code-block:: bash

    python/run-tests --testnames pyspark.sql.tests.test_arrow

Please refer to `Testing PySpark <https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html>`_ for more details.


Running Tests using GitHub Actions
----------------------------------

You can run the full PySpark tests by using GitHub Actions in your own forked GitHub
repository with a few clicks. Please refer to
`Running tests in your forked repository using GitHub Actions <https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html>`_ for more details.


Running Tests for Spark Connect
-------------------------------

Running Tests for Python Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to test the changes in Protobuf definitions, for example, at
`spark/sql/connect/common/src/main/protobuf/spark/connect <https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/sql/connect/common/src/main/protobuf/spark/connect>`_,
you should regenerate Python Protobuf client first by running ``dev/connect-gen-protos.sh``.


Running PySpark Shell with Python Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command below starts Spark Connect server automatically locally, and creates a Spark Connect client connected to the server.

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/pyspark --remote "local[*]"
