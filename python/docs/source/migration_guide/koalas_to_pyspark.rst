============================================
Migrating from Koalas to pandas API on Spark
============================================

* The package name to import should be changed to ``pyspark.pandas`` from ``databricks.koalas``.

   .. code-block:: python
   
      # import databricks.koalas as ks
      import pyspark.pandas as ps

* ``DataFrame.koalas`` in Koalas DataFrame was renamed to ``DataFrame.pandas_on_spark`` in pandas-on-Spark DataFrame. ``DataFrame.koalas`` was removed as of Spark 4.0.

* Monkey-patched ``DataFrame.to_koalas`` in PySpark DataFrame was renamed to ``DataFrame.pandas_api`` in PySpark DataFrame. ``DataFrame.to_koalas`` was removed as of Spark 4.0.

* Monkey-patched ``DataFrame.to_pandas_on_spark`` in PySpark DataFrame was renamed to ``DataFrame.pandas_api`` in PySpark DataFrame. ``DataFrame.to_pandas_on_spark`` was removed as of Spark 4.0.

* ``databricks.koalas.__version__`` was removed. ``pyspark.__version__`` should be used instead.
