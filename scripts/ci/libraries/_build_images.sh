${COLOR_BLUE}***** Beginning of the instructions ****${COLOR_RESET}

The image did not pass 'pip check' verification. This means that there are some conflicting dependencies
in the image.

It can mean one of those:

1) The master is currently broken (other PRs will fail with the same error)
2) You changed some dependencies in setup.py or setup.cfg and they are conflicting.



In case 1) - apologies for the trouble.Please let committers know and they will fix it. You might
be asked to rebase to the latest master after the problem is fixed.

In case 2) - Follow the steps below:

* try to build CI and then PROD image locally with breeze, adding --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies flag
  (repeat it for all python versions)

CI image:

${COLOR_BLUE}
     ./breeze build-image --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies --python 3.6
${COLOR_RESET}

Production image:

${COLOR_BLUE}
     ./breeze build-image --production-image --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies --python 3.6
${COLOR_RESET}

* If you want to build the image regardless if 'pip check' fails for it, you can add
  --continue-on-pip-check-failure flag and enter the image and inspect dependencies.

CI image:

${COLOR_BLUE}
     ./breeze build-image --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies --python 3.6 --continue-on-pip-check-failure
     docker run -it apache/airflow:master-3.6-ci bash
${COLOR_RESET}

Production image:

${COLOR_BLUE}
     ./breeze build-image --production-image --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies --python 3.6 --continue-on-pip-check-failure
     docker run -it apache/airflow:master-3.6 bash
${COLOR_RESET}

* You will see error messages there telling which requirements are conflicting and which packages caused the
  conflict. Add the limitation that caused the conflict to EAGER_UPGRADE_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS
  variable in Dockerfile.ci. Note that the limitations might be different for Dockerfile.ci and Dockerfile
  because not all packages are installed by default in the PROD Dockerfile. So you might find that you
  only need to add the limitation to the Dockerfile.ci
