The upstart files in this directory are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS based systems running in VPC on AWS.

Copy *.conf files to /etc/init.

You can then start airflow services by using initctl start <service>. Where <service> is airflow-worker,
airflow-webserver, airflow-scheduler, etc.

Upstart automatically starts all airflow services for which you have a corresponding *.conf file in /etc/init
upon system boot. If service process dies, upstart will automatically re-spawn it (until it hits re-spawn limit
set in a *.conf file)

You may have to adjust `start on` & `stop on` stanzas to make it work on other upstart systems. Some of the possible
options are listed bellow

# This should work on most Linux distributions that support upstart
start on started network-services

# This is for Ubuntu based systems which lack generic network-services job
# Wait for a non-loopback interface before starting airflow services
start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)

# This should work on Ubuntu 11.10 based systems
# Start after all network interfaces are up
start on static-network-up

# If nothing else works, use this
start on runlevel [2345]

It is assumed that airflow will run under `airflow:airflow`. Change `setuid` and `setgid` in *.conf files
if you use other user/group

You can use `initctl` to manually start, stop, view status of the airflow process.  For example
`initctl status airflow-webserver`
