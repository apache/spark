/**
 * A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that offers an approximate
 * containment test with one-sided error: if it claims that an item is contained in it, this
 * might be in error, but if it claims that an item is <i>not</i> contained in it, then this is
 * definitely true. Currently supported data types include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Byte}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Short}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Integer}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Long}</li>
 *   <li>{@link String}</li>
 * </ul>
 * The false positive probability ({@code FPP}) of a Bloom filter is defined as the probability that
 * {@linkplain #mightContain(Object)} will erroneously return {@code true} for an object that has
 * not actually been put in the {@code BloomFilter}.
 *
 * The implementation is largely based on the {@code BloomFilter} class from Guava.
