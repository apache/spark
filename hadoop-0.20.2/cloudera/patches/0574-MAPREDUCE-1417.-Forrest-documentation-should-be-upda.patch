+            <p>DistributedCache files can be private or public, that 
+               determines how they can be shared on the slave nodes.</p>
+            <ul>
+              <li>"Private" DistributedCache files are cached in a local
+              directory private to the user whose jobs need these
+              files. These files are shared by all
+              tasks and jobs of the specific user only and cannot be accessed by
+              jobs of other users on the slaves. A DistributedCache file becomes private by
+              virtue of its permissions on the file system where the files
+              are uploaded, typically HDFS. If the file has no world readable
+              access, or if the directory path leading to the file has no
+              world executable access for lookup, then the file becomes private.
+              </li>
+              <li>"Public" DistributedCache files are cached in a global
+              directory and the file access is setup such that they are 
+              publicly visible to all users. These files can be shared by
+              tasks and jobs of all users on the slaves.
+              A DistributedCache file becomes public by virtue of its permissions
+              on the file system where the files are uploaded, typically HDFS. 
+              If the file has world readable access, AND if the directory
+              path leading to the file has world executable access for lookup,
+              then the file becomes public. In other words, if the user intends
+              to make a file publicly available to all users, the file permissions
+              must be set to be world readable, and the directory permissions
+              on the path leading to the file must be world executable.
