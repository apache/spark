 <section><title>User Identity</title>
 <p>
-In this release of Hadoop the identity of a client process is just whatever the host operating system says it is. For Unix-like systems,
+As of CDH3, Hadoop supports two different modes of operation to determine the user's identity, specified by the
+<code>hadoop.security.authentication</code> property:
 </p>
-<ul>
-<li>
-   The user name is the equivalent of <code>`whoami`</code>;
-</li>
-<li>
-   The group list is the equivalent of <code>`bash -c groups`</code>.
-</li>

+<dl>
+  <dt><code>simple</code></dt>
+  <dd>In this mode of operation, the identity of a client process is determined by the host operating system. On Unix-like systems,
+  the user name is the equivalent of <code>`whoami`</code>.</dd>
+  <dt><code>kerberos</code></dt>
+  <dd>In Kerberized operation, the identity of a client process is determined by its Kerberos credentials. For example, in a
+  Kerberized environment, a user may use the <code>kinit</code> utility to obtain a Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) and
+  use <code>klist</code> to determine their current principal. When mapping a Kerberos principal to an HDFS username, all <em>components</em> except for the <em>primary</em> are dropped. For example, a principal <code>todd/foobar@CORP.COMPANY.COM</code> will act as the simple username <code>todd</code> on HDFS.
+  </dd>
+</dl>
+<p>
+Regardless of the mode of operation, the user identity mechanism is extrinsic to HDFS itself.
+There is no provision within HDFS for creating user identities, establishing groups, or processing user credentials.
+</p>
+</section>
 
+<section><title>Group Mapping</title>
+<p>
+Once a username has been determined as described above, the list of groups is determined by a <em>group mapping
+service</em>, configured by the <code>hadoop.security.group.mapping</code> property.
+The default implementation, <code>org.apache.hadoop.security.ShellBasedUnixGroupsMapping</code>, will shell out
+to the Unix <code>bash -c groups</code> command to resolve a list of groups for a user.
+</p>
 <p>
-In the future there will be other ways of establishing user identity (think Kerberos, LDAP, and others). There is no expectation that 
-this first method is secure in protecting one user from impersonating another. This user identity mechanism combined with the 
-permissions model allows a cooperative community to share file system resources in an organized fashion.
+For HDFS, the mapping of users to groups is performed on the NameNode. Thus, the host system configuration of
+the NameNode determines the group mappings for the users.
 </p>
 <p>
-In any case, the user identity mechanism is extrinsic to HDFS itself. There is no provision within HDFS for creating user identities, 
-establishing groups, or processing user credentials.
+Note that HDFS stores the user and group of a file or directory as strings; there is no conversion from user and
+group identity numbers as is conventional in Unix.
