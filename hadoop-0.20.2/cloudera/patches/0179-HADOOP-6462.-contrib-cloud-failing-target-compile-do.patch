Subject: [PATCH 0179/1179] HADOOP-6462. contrib/cloud failing, target "compile" does not exist

Description: I'm not seeing this mentioned in hudson or other bugreports, which confuses me. With the addition of a src/contrib/cloud/build.xml from <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6426" title="Create ant build for running EC2 unit tests"><del>HADOOP-6426</del></a>, contrib/build.xml won't build no more: <br/>
hadoop-common/src/contrib/build.xml:30: The following error occurred while executing this line:<br/>
Target "compile" does not exist in the project "hadoop-cloud".

<p>What is odd is this: the final patch of <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6426" title="Create ant build for running EC2 unit tests"><del>HADOOP-6426</del></a> does include the stub &lt;target&gt; files needed, yet they aren't in SVN_HEAD. Which implies that a different version may have gone in than intended. </p>
Reason: Build system bugfix
