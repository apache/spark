Subject: [PATCH 0173/1179] HDFS-860. fuse-dfs truncate behavior causes issues with scp

Description: For whatever reason, scp issues a "truncate" once it's written a file to truncate the file to the # of bytes it has written (i.e., if a file is X bytes, it calls truncate(X)).

<p>This fails on the current fuse-dfs.</p>
Reason: bugfix (tool compatibility)
