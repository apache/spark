Subject: [PATCH 1006/1179] HDFS-1897. Documention refers to removed option dfs.network.script.

The HDFS user guide tells users to use dfs.network.script for rack
awareness. In fact, this option has been removed and using it will
trigger a fatal error on DataNode startup. Documentation should
describe the current rack awareness configuration system.

Reason: Bug
