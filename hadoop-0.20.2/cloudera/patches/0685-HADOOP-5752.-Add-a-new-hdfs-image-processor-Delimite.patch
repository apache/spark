+        via the <code>-delimiter</code> command line argument. This processor is designed to

+      <title>Analyzing results of Offline Image Viewer</title>
+      <p>The Offline Image Viewer makes it easy to gather large amounts of data about the hdfs namespace.
+         This information can then be used to explore file system usage patterns or find
+        specific files that match arbitrary criteria, along with other types of namespace analysis. The Delimited 
+         image processor in particular creates
+        output that is amenable to further processing by tools such as <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/">Apache Pig</a>. Pig provides a particularly
+        good choice for analyzing these data as it is able to deal with the output generated from a small fsimage
+        but also scales up to consume data from extremely large file systems.</p>
+      <p>The Delimited image processor generates lines of text separated, by default, by tabs and includes
+        all of the fields that are common between constructed files and files that were still under constructed
+        when the fsimage was generated. Examples scripts are provided demonstrating how to use this output to 
+        accomplish three tasks: determine the number of files each user has created on the file system,
+        find files were created but have not accessed, and find probable duplicates of large files by comparing
+        the size of each file.</p>
+      <p>Each of the following scripts assumes you have generated an output file using the Delimited processor named
+        <code>foo</code> and will be storing the results of the Pig analysis in a file named <code>results</code>.</p>
