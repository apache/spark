Subject: [PATCH 0156/1179] MAPREDUCE-1224. Calling "SELECT t.* from <table> AS t" to get meta information is too expensive for big tables

Description: The SqlManager uses the query, "SELECT t.* from &lt;table&gt; AS t" to get table spec is too expensive for big tables, and it was called twice to generate column names and types.  For tables that are big enough to be map-reduced, this is too expensive to make sqoop useful.
Reason: Performance improvement
