+Direct-mode Imports
+------------------
+
+While the JDBC-based import method used by Sqoop provides it with the
+ability to read from a variety of databases using a generic driver, it
+is not the most high-performance method available. Sqoop can read from
+certain database systems faster by using their built-in export tools.
+
+For example, Sqoop can read from a local MySQL database by using the +mysqldump+
+tool distributed with MySQL. If you run Sqoop on the same machine where a
+MySQL database is present, you can take advantage of this faster
+import method by running Sqoop with the +--direct+ argument. This
+combined with a connect string that begins with +jdbc:mysql://+ will
+inform Sqoop that it should select the faster access method.
+
+If your delimiters exactly match the delimiters used by +mysqldump+,
+then Sqoop will use a fast-path that copies the data directly from
++mysqldump+'s output into HDFS. Otherwise, Sqoop will parse +mysqldump+'s
+output into fields and transcode them into the user-specified delimiter set.
+This incurs additional processing, so performance may suffer.
+For convenience, the +--mysql-delimiters+
+argument will set all the output delimiters to be consistent with
++mysqldump+'s format.
+
+Sqoop also provides a direct-mode backend for PostgreSQL that uses the
++COPY TO STDOUT+ protocol from +psql+. No specific delimiter set provides
+better performance; Sqoop will forward delimiter control arguments to
++psql+.
+
+The "Supported Databases" section provides a full list of database vendors
+which have direct-mode support from Sqoop.
