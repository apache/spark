Subject: [PATCH 0025/1179] HADOOP-5613. change S3Exception to checked exception

Description: Currently the S3 filesystems can throw unchecked exceptions (S3Exception) which are not declared in the interface of FileSystem. These aren't caught by the various callers and can cause unpredictable behavior. IOExceptions are caught by most users of FileSystem since it is declared in the interface and hence is handled better.

S3Exception now extends IOException.
Reason: Improved error-checking at compile time for user applications.
