This package is a distributed implementation of Knuth's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links">dancing links</a>
algorithm that can run under Hadoop. It is a generic model for
problems, such as tile placement, where all of the valid choices can
be represented as a large sparse boolean array where the goal is to
pick a subset of the rows to end up with exactly 1 <b>true</b> value
in each column.

<p>

The package includes two example applications: a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino">pentomino</a> solver and
a sudoku solver. 

<p>

The pentomino includes both a "normal" pentomino set and a one-sided
set where the tiles that are different when flipped are
duplicated. The pentomino solver has a Hadoop driver application to
launch it on a cluster. In Knuth's paper on dancing links, he
describes trying and failing to solve the one-sided pentomino in a
9x10 board. With the advances of computers and a cluster, it takes a
small (12 node) hadoop cluster 9 hours to find all of the solutions
that Knuth estimated would have taken him months.

<p>

The sudoku solver is so fast, I didn't bother making a distributed
version. (All of the puzzles that I've tried, including a 42x42 have
taken around a second to solve.) On the command line, give the solver
a list of puzzle files to solve. Puzzle files have a line per a row
and columns separated by spaces. The squares either have numbers or
'?' to mean unknown.

<p>

Both applications have been added to the examples jar, so they can be
run as:

<pre>
bin/hadoop jar hadoop-examples-*.jar pentomino pent-outdir
bin/hadoop jar hadoop-examples-*.jar sudoku puzzle.txt
</pre>

<p>

I (Owen) implemented the original version of the distributed pentomino
solver for a Yahoo Hack day, where Yahoos get to work on a project of
their own choosing for a day to make something cool. The following
afternoon, everyone gets to show off their hacks and gets a free
t-shirt. I had a lot of fun doing it.
