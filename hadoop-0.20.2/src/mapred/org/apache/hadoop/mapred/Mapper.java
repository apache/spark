/** 
 * Maps input key/value pairs to a set of intermediate key/value pairs.  
 * 
 * <p>Maps are the individual tasks which transform input records into a 
 * intermediate records. The transformed intermediate records need not be of 
 * the same type as the input records. A given input pair may map to zero or 
 * many output pairs.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>The Hadoop Map-Reduce framework spawns one map task for each 
 * {@link InputSplit} generated by the {@link InputFormat} for the job.
 * <code>Mapper</code> implementations can access the {@link JobConf} for the 
 * job via the {@link JobConfigurable#configure(JobConf)} and initialize
 * themselves. Similarly they can use the {@link Closeable#close()} method for
 * de-initialization.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The framework then calls 
 * {@link #map(Object, Object, OutputCollector, Reporter)} 
 * for each key/value pair in the <code>InputSplit</code> for that task.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All intermediate values associated with a given output key are 
 * subsequently grouped by the framework, and passed to a {@link Reducer} to  
 * determine the final output. Users can control the grouping by specifying
 * a <code>Comparator</code> via 
 * {@link JobConf#setOutputKeyComparatorClass(Class)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The grouped <code>Mapper</code> outputs are partitioned per 
 * <code>Reducer</code>. Users can control which keys (and hence records) go to 
 * which <code>Reducer</code> by implementing a custom {@link Partitioner}.
 * 
 * <p>Users can optionally specify a <code>combiner</code>, via 
 * {@link JobConf#setCombinerClass(Class)}, to perform local aggregation of the 
 * intermediate outputs, which helps to cut down the amount of data transferred 
 * from the <code>Mapper</code> to the <code>Reducer</code>.
 * 
 * <p>The intermediate, grouped outputs are always stored in 
 * {@link SequenceFile}s. Applications can specify if and how the intermediate
 * outputs are to be compressed and which {@link CompressionCodec}s are to be
 * used via the <code>JobConf</code>.</p>
 *  
 * <p>If the job has 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobConf.html#ReducerNone">zero
 * reduces</a> then the output of the <code>Mapper</code> is directly written
 * to the {@link FileSystem} without grouping by keys.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example:</p>
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 *     public class MyMapper&lt;K extends WritableComparable, V extends Writable&gt; 
 *     extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper&lt;K, V, K, V&gt; {
 *     
 *       static enum MyCounters { NUM_RECORDS }
 *       
 *       private String mapTaskId;
 *       private String inputFile;
 *       private int noRecords = 0;
 *       
 *       public void configure(JobConf job) {
 *         mapTaskId = job.get("mapred.task.id");
 *         inputFile = job.get("map.input.file");
 *       }
 *       
 *       public void map(K key, V val,
 *                       OutputCollector&lt;K, V&gt; output, Reporter reporter)
 *       throws IOException {
 *         // Process the &lt;key, value&gt; pair (assume this takes a while)
 *         // ...
 *         // ...
 *         
 *         // Let the framework know that we are alive, and kicking!
 *         // reporter.progress();
 *         
 *         // Process some more
 *         // ...
 *         // ...
 *         
 *         // Increment the no. of &lt;key, value&gt; pairs processed
 *         ++noRecords;
 *
 *         // Increment counters
 *         reporter.incrCounter(NUM_RECORDS, 1);
 *        
 *         // Every 100 records update application-level status
 *         if ((noRecords%100) == 0) {
 *           reporter.setStatus(mapTaskId + " processed " + noRecords + 
 *                              " from input-file: " + inputFile); 
 *         }
 *         
 *         // Output the result
 *         output.collect(key, val);
 *       }
 *     }

 * control on map processing e.g. multi-threaded <code>Mapper</code>s etc.</p>
