<body>

<p>
A distributed implementation of {@link
org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem} for reading and writing files on
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>.
Unlike {@link org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3.S3FileSystem}, which is block-based,
this implementation stores
files on S3 in their native form for interoperability with other S3 tools.
