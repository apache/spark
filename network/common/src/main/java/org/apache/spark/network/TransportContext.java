 *
 * There are two communication protocols that the TransportClient provides, control-plane RPCs and
 * data-plane "chunk fetching". The handling of the RPCs is performed outside of the scope of the
 * TransportContext (i.e., by a user-provided handler), and it is responsible for setting up streams
 * which can be streamed through the data plane in chunks using zero-copy IO.
 *
 * The TransportServer and TransportClientFactory both create a TransportChannelHandler for each
 * channel. As each TransportChannelHandler contains a TransportClient, this enables server
 * processes to send messages back to the client on an existing channel.
