-- This is to test the union->selectstar->filesink optimization
-- Union of 2 map-reduce subqueries is performed followed by select star and a file sink
-- and the results are written to a table using dynamic partitions.
-- There is no need to write the temporary results of the sub-queries, and then read them 
-- again to process the union. The union can be removed completely.
-- It does not matter, whether the output is merged or not. In this case, merging is turned
-- on
-- This test demonstrates that this optimization works in the presence of dynamic partitions.

-- to run the test only on hadoop 23
