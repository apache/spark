/**
 * Helper object for building ORC `SearchArgument`s, which are used for ORC predicate push-down.
 *
 * Due to limitation of ORC `SearchArgument` builder, we had to end up with a pretty weird double-
 * checking pattern when converting `And`/`Or`/`Not` filters.
 *
 * An ORC `SearchArgument` must be built in one pass using a single builder.  For example, you can't
 * build `a = 1` and `b = 2` first, and then combine them into `a = 1 AND b = 2`.  This is quite
 * different from the cases in Spark SQL or Parquet, where complex filters can be easily built using
 * existing simpler ones.
 *
 * The annoying part is that, `SearchArgument` builder methods like `startAnd()`, `startOr()`, and
 * `startNot()` mutate internal state of the builder instance.  This forces us to translate all
 * convertible filters with a single builder instance. However, before actually converting a filter,
 * we've no idea whether it can be recognized by ORC or not. Thus, when an inconvertible filter is
 * found, we may already end up with a builder whose internal state is inconsistent.
 *
 * For example, to convert an `And` filter with builder `b`, we call `b.startAnd()` first, and then
 * try to convert its children.  Say we convert `left` child successfully, but find that `right`
 * child is inconvertible.  Alas, `b.startAnd()` call can't be rolled back, and `b` is inconsistent
 * now.
 *
 * The workaround employed here is that, for `And`/`Or`/`Not`, we first try to convert their
 * children with brand new builders, and only do the actual conversion with the right builder
 * instance when the children are proven to be convertible.
 *
 * P.S.: Hive seems to use `SearchArgument` together with `ExprNodeGenericFuncDesc` only.  Usage of
 * builder methods mentioned above can only be found in test code, where all tested filters are
 * known to be convertible.
