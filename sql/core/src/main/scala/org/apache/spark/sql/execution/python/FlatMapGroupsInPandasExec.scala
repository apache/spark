/**
 * Physical node for [[org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.FlatMapGroupsInPandas]]
 *
 * Rows in each group are passed to the Python worker as an Arrow record batch.
 * The Python worker turns the record batch to a `pandas.DataFrame`, invoke the
 * user-defined function, and passes the resulting `pandas.DataFrame`
 * as an Arrow record batch. Finally, each record batch is turned to
 * Iterator[InternalRow] using ColumnarBatch.
 *
 * Note on memory usage:
 * Both the Python worker and the Java executor need to have enough memory to
 * hold the largest group. The memory on the Java side is used to construct the
 * record batch (off heap memory). The memory on the Python side is used for
 * holding the `pandas.DataFrame`. It's possible to further split one group into
 * multiple record batches to reduce the memory footprint on the Java side, this
 * is left as future work.
