 *
 * As reading from many small files is usually pretty slow, [[FileStreamSinkLog]] will compact log
 * files every "spark.sql.sink.file.log.compactLen" batches into a big file. When doing a
 * compaction, it will read all old log files and merge them with the new batch. During the
 * compaction, it will also delete the files that are deleted (marked by [[SinkFileStatus.action]]).
 * When the reader uses `allFiles` to list all files, this method only returns the visible files
