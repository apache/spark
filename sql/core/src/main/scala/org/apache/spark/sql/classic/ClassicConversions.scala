/**
 * Conversions from sql interfaces to the Classic specific implementation.
 *
 * This class is mainly used by the implementation. It is also meant to be used by extension
 * developers.
 *
 * We provide both a trait and an object. The trait is useful in situations where an extension
 * developer needs to use these conversions in a project covering multiple Spark versions. They can
 * create a shim for these conversions, the Spark 4+ version of the shim implements this trait, and
 * shims for older versions do not.
