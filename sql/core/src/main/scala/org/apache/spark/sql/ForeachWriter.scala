/**
 * :: Experimental ::
 * A class to consume data generated by a [[StreamingQuery]]. Typically this is used to send the
 * generated data to external systems. Each partition will use a new deserialized instance, so you
 * usually should do all the initialization (e.g. opening a connection or initiating a transaction)
 * in the `open` method.
 *
 * Scala example:
 * {{{
 *   datasetOfString.write.foreach(new ForeachWriter[String] {
 *
 *     def open(partitionId: Long, version: Long): Boolean = {
 *       // open connection
 *     }
 *
 *     def process(record: String) = {
 *       // write string to connection
 *     }
 *
 *     def close(errorOrNull: Throwable): Unit = {
 *       // close the connection
 *     }
 *   })
 * }}}
 *
 * Java example:
 * {{{
 *  datasetOfString.write().foreach(new ForeachWriter<String>() {
 *
 *    @Override
 *    public boolean open(long partitionId, long version) {
 *      // open connection
 *    }
 *
 *    @Override
 *    public void process(String value) {
 *      // write string to connection
 *    }
 *
 *    @Override
 *    public void close(Throwable errorOrNull) {
 *      // close the connection
 *    }
 *  });
 * }}}
