  /**
   * A buffer that is designed for the sole purpose of buffering UnsafeRows in PythonForeachWriter.
   * It is designed to be used with only two threads: the QueryExecutionThread which writes data
   * to the buffer and [[WriterThread]] thread that reads from the buffer and writes to the
   * Python worker stdin. Adds to the buffer are non-blocking, and reads through the buffer's
   * iterator are blocking, that is, it blocks until new data is available or all data has been
   * added.
   *
   * Internally, it uses a [[HybridRowQueue]] to buffer the rows in a practically unlimited queue
   * across memory and local disk. However, HybridRowQueue is designed to be used only with
   * EvalPythonExec where the buffer's consumer is always behind the buffer's populator, that is,
   * the [[WriterThread]] does not try to read n + 1 rows if the streaming thread has only
   * written n rows at any point of time. This assumption is not true for PythonForeachWriter
   * where rows may be added at a different rate as they are consumed by the Python worker.
   * Hence, to maintain the invariant of the reader being behind the writer while using
   * HybridRowQueue, the buffer does the following:
   * - Keeps a count of the rows in the HybridRowQueue
   * - Blocks the buffer's consuming iterator when the count is 0 so that the reader does not
   *   try to read more rows than what has been written.
   *
   * The implementation of the blocking iterator (ReentrantLock, Condition, etc.) has been borrowed
   * from that of ArrayBlockingQueue.
