/**
 * A state machine that manages the lifecycle of a RocksDB instance
 *
 * This class enforces proper state transitions and ensures thread-safety for accessing
 * RocksDB instances.
 * It prevents concurrent modifications to the same native RocksDB instance by using
 * a stamp-based locking mechanism.
 *
 * State Lifecycle:
 * - RELEASED: The RocksDB instance is not being accessed by any thread
 * - ACQUIRED: The RocksDB instance is currently being accessed by a thread
 * - CLOSED: The RocksDB instance has been closed and can no longer be used
 *
 * Valid Transitions:
 * - RELEASED -> ACQUIRED: When a thread acquires the RocksDB instance
 * - ACQUIRED -> RELEASED: When a thread releases the RocksDB instance
 * - RELEASED -> CLOSED: When the RocksDB instance is shut down
 * - ACQUIRED -> MAINTENANCE: Maintenance can be performed on an acquired RocksDB instance
 * - RELEASED -> MAINTENANCE: Maintenance can be performed on a released RocksDB instance
 *
 * Stamps:
 * Each time a RocksDB instance is acquired, a unique stamp is generated. This stamp must be
 * presented when performing operations on the RocksDB instance and when releasing it. This ensures
 * that only the stamp owner that acquired the RocksDB instance can release it or perform
 * operations.
