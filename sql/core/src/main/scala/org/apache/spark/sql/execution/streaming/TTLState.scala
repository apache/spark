/**
 * Any state variable that wants to support TTL must implement this trait,
 * which they can do by extending [[OneToOneTTLState]] or [[OneToManyTTLState]].
 *
 * The only required methods here are ones relating to evicting expired and all
 * state, via clearExpiredStateForAllKeys and clearAllStateForElementKey,
 * respectively. How classes do this is implementation detail, but the general
 * pattern is to use secondary indexes to make sure cleanup scans
 * theta(records to evict), not theta(all records).
 *
 * There are two broad patterns of implementing stateful variables, and thus
 * there are two broad patterns for implementing TTL. The first is when there
 * is a one-to-one mapping between an element key [1] and a value; the primary
 * and secondary index management for this case is implemented by
 * [[OneToOneTTLState]]. When a single element key can have multiple values,
 * all of which can expire at their own, unique times, then
 * [[OneToManyTTLState]] should be used.
 *
 * In either case, implementations need to use some sort of secondary index
 * that orders element keys by expiration time. This base functionality
 * is provided by methods in this trait that read/write/delete to the
 * so-called "TTL index". It is a secondary index with the layout of
 * (expirationMs, elementKey) -> EMPTY_ROW. The expirationMs is big-endian
 * encoded to allow for efficient range scans to find all expired keys.
 *
 * TTLState (or any abstract sub-classes) should never deal with encoding or
 * decoding UnsafeRows to and from their user-facing types. The stateful variable
 * themselves should be doing this; all other TTLState sub-classes should be concerned
 * only with writing, reading, and deleting UnsafeRows and their associated
 * expirations from the primary and secondary indexes. [2]
 *
 * [1]. You might ask, why call it "element key" instead of "grouping key"?
 *      This is because a single grouping key might have multiple elements, as in
 *      the case of a map, which has composite keys of the form (groupingKey, mapKey).
 *      In the case of ValueState, though, the element key is the grouping key.
 *      To generalize to both cases, this class should always use the term elementKey.)
 *
 * [2]. You might also ask, why design it this way? We want the TTLState abstract
 *      sub-classes to write to both the primary and secondary indexes, since they
 *      both need to stay in sync; co-locating the logic is cleanest.

 * on the key (expirationMs, groupingKey, indexInList), since we have no way to delete a

 * though it behaves more like a work queue of lists that need to be cleaned up.

 * minimum expiration is, we need to reverse this work queue index. This reversed index
 * maps from key to the minimum expiration in the list, and it is called the "min-expiry" index.
