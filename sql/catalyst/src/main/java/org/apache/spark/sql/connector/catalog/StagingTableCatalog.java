/**
 * An optional mix-in for implementations of {@link TableCatalog} that support staging creation of
 * the a table before committing the table's metadata along with its contents in CREATE TABLE AS
 * SELECT or REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT operations.
 * <p>
 * It is highly recommended to implement this trait whenever possible so that CREATE TABLE AS
 * SELECT and REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT operations are atomic. For example, when one runs a REPLACE
 * TABLE AS SELECT operation, if the catalog does not implement this trait, the planner will first
 * drop the table via {@link TableCatalog#dropTable(Identifier)}, then create the table via
 * {@link TableCatalog#createTable(Identifier, Column[], Transform[], Map)}, and then perform
 * the write via {@link SupportsWrite#newWriteBuilder(LogicalWriteInfo)}.
 * However, if the write operation fails, the catalog will have already dropped the table, and the
 * planner cannot roll back the dropping of the table.
 * <p>
 * If the catalog implements this plugin, the catalog can implement the methods to "stage" the
 * creation and the replacement of a table. After the table's
 * {@link BatchWrite#commit(WriterCommitMessage[])} is called,
 * {@link StagedTable#commitStagedChanges()} is called, at which point the staged table can
 * complete both the data write and the metadata swap operation atomically.
