/**
 * A [[Set]] where membership is determined based on determinacy and a canonical representation of
 * an [[Expression]] (i.e. one that attempts to ignore cosmetic differences).
 * See [[Expression#canonicalized]] for more details.
 *
 * Internally this set uses the canonical representation, but keeps also track of the original
 * expressions to ease debugging.  Since different expressions can share the same canonical
 * representation, this means that operations that extract expressions from this set are only
 * guaranteed to see at least one such expression.  For example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val set = ExpressionSet(a + 1, 1 + a)
 *
 *   set.iterator => Iterator(a + 1)
 *   set.contains(a + 1) => true
 *   set.contains(1 + a) => true
 *   set.contains(a + 2) => false
 * }}}
 *
 * For non-deterministic expressions, they are always considered as not contained in the [[Set]].
 * On adding a non-deterministic expression, simply append it to the original expressions.
 * This is consistent with how we define `semanticEquals` between two expressions.
 *
 * The constructor of this class is protected so caller can only initialize an Expression from
 * empty, then build it using `add` and `remove` methods. So every instance of this class holds the
 * invariant that:
 * 1. Every expr `e` in `baseSet` satisfies `e.deterministic && e.canonicalized == e`
 * 2. Every deterministic expr `e` in `originals` satisfies that `e.canonicalized` is already
 *    accessed.
