/**
 * [[BinaryArithmeticResolver]] is invoked by [[ExpressionResolver]] in order to resolve
 * [[BinaryArithmetic]] nodes. During resolution, calling [[BinaryArithmeticWithDatetimeResolver]]
 * and applying type coercion can result in [[BinaryArithmetic]] producing some other type of node
 * or a subtree of nodes. In such cases a downwards traversal is necessary, but not going deeper
 * than the original expression's children, since all nodes below that point are guaranteed to be
 * already resolved.
 *
 * For example, given a query:
 *
 *  SELECT '4 11:11' - INTERVAL '4 22:12' DAY TO MINUTE
 *
 * [[BinaryArithmeticResolver]] is called for the following expression:
 *
 *     Subtract(
 *         Literal('4 11:11', StringType),
 *         Literal(Interval('4 22:12' DAY TO MINUTE), DayTimeIntervalType(0,2))
 *     )
 *
 * After calling [[BinaryArithmeticWithDatetimeResolver]] and applying type coercion,
 * the expression is transformed into:
 *
 *     Cast(
 *         DatetimeSub(
 *             TimeAdd(
 *                 Literal('4 11:11', StringType),
 *                 UnaryMinus(
 *                     Literal(Interval('4 22:12' DAY TO MINUTE), DayTimeIntervalType(0,2))
 *                 )
 *             )
 *         )
 *     )
 *
 * A single [[Subtract]] node is replaced with a subtree of nodes. In order to resolve this subtree
 * we need to invoke [[ExpressionResolver]] recursively on the top-most node's children. The
 * top-most node itself is not resolved recursively in order to avoid recursive calls to
 * [[BinaryArithmeticResolver]] and other sub-resolvers. To prevent a case where we resolve the
 * same node twice, we need to mark nodes that will act as a limit for the downwards traversal by
 * applying a [[ExpressionResolver.SINGLE_PASS_SUBTREE_BOUNDARY]] tag to them. These children
 * along with all the nodes below them are guaranteed to be resolved at this point. When
 * [[ExpressionResolver]] reaches one of the tagged nodes, it returns identity rather than
 * resolving it. Finally, after resolving the subtree, we need to resolve the top-most node itself,
 * which in this case means applying a timezone, if necessary.
