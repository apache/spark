/**
 * Analyze WITH nodes and substitute child plan with CTE references or CTE definitions depending
 * on the conditions below:
 * 1. If in legacy mode, replace with CTE definitions, i.e., inline CTEs.
 * 2. Otherwise, replace with CTE references `CTERelationRef`s. The decision to inline or not
 *    inline will be made later by the rule `InlineCTE` after query analysis.
 *
 * All the CTE definitions that are not inlined after this substitution will be grouped together
 * under one `WithCTE` node for each of the main query and the subqueries. Any of the main query
 * or the subqueries that do not contain CTEs or have had all CTEs inlined will obviously not have
 * any `WithCTE` nodes. If any though, the `WithCTE` node will be in the same place as where the
 * outermost `With` node once was.
 *
 * The CTE definitions in a `WithCTE` node are kept in the order of how they have been resolved.
 * That means the CTE definitions are guaranteed to be in topological order base on their
 * dependency for any valid CTE query (i.e., given CTE definitions A and B with B referencing A,
 * A is guaranteed to appear before B). Otherwise, it must be an invalid user query, and an
 * analysis exception will be thrown later by relation resolving rules.
 *
 * If the query is a SQL command or DML statement (extends `CTEInChildren`),
 * place `WithCTE` into their children.
