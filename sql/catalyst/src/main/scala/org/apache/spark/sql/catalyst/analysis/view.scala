 * Make sure that a view's child plan produces the view's output attributes. We try to wrap the
 * child by:
 * 1. Generate the `queryOutput` by:
 *    1.1. If the query column names are defined, map the column names to attributes in the child
 *         output by name(This is mostly for handling view queries like SELECT * FROM ..., the
 *         schema of the referenced table/view may change after the view has been created, so we
 *         have to save the output of the query to `viewQueryColumnNames`, and restore them during
 *         view resolution, in this way, we are able to get the correct view column ordering and
 *         omit the extra columns that we don't require);
 *    1.2. Else set the child output attributes to `queryOutput`.
 * 2. Map the `queryOutput` to view output by index, if the corresponding attributes don't match,
 *    try to up cast and alias the attribute in `queryOutput` to the attribute in the view output.
 * 3. Add a Project over the child, with the new output generated by the previous steps.
 * If the view output doesn't have the same number of columns neither with the child output, nor
 * with the query column names, throw an AnalysisException.
 *
 * This should be only done after the batch of Resolution, because the view attributes are not
 * completely resolved during the batch of Resolution.
