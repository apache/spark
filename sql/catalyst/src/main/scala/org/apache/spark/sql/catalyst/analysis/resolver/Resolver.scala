 * This is the primary entry point for implementing SQL and DataFrame plan analysis,
 * wherein the [[resolve]] method accepts a fully unresolved [[LogicalPlan]] and returns
 * a fully resolved [[LogicalPlan]] in response with all data types and attribute
 * reference ID assigned for valid requests. This resolver also takes responsibility
 * to detect any errors in the initial SQL query or DataFrame and return appropriate
 * error messages including precise parse locations wherever possible.

 * re-create it for every new analysis run.
