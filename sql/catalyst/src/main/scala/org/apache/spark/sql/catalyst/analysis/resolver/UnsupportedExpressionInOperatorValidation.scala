   * Check that `expression` is allowed to exist in `operator`'s expression tree. Here, we avoid
   * validating [[AggregateExpression]]s when they are under a [[Sort]] or [[Filter]] on top of
   * [[Aggregate]] as the transformation to attributes is delayed to specific resolvers (if
   * needed). Example:
   *
   * {{{ SELECT SUM(col1) + 1 FROM VALUES(1) ORDER BY SUM(col1) + 1 }}}
   *
   * In this case, ordering [[AggregateExpression]] in `SUM(col1) + 1` should be allowed here
   * as its parent expression `SUM(col1) + 1` will be transformed to attribute later in
   * [[GroupingAndAggregateExpressionsExtractor.extractReferencedGroupingAndAggregateExpressions]]
   * and thus at the end of [[Sort]] resolution we won't have any [[AggregateExpression]]s in its
   * ordering expression tree. On the other side, here is a query that should fail:
   *
   * {{{ SELECT col1 FROM VALUES(1) ORDER BY MAX(col1) }}}
   *
   * `MAX(col1)` can't be extracted as the child of the [[Sort]] is [[Project]] and thus we fail
   * during validation in [[Resolver.validateResolvedOperatorGenerically]].
