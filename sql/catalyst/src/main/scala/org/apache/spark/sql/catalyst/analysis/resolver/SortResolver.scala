  /**
   * Resolve [[Sort]] operator.
   *
   *  1. Resolve [[Sort.child]] and set [[NameScope.ordinalReplacementExpressions]] for
   *     [[SortOrder]] resolution.
   *  2. Resolve order expressions using [[ExpressionResolver.resolveExpressionTreeInOperator]].
   *  3. In case order expressions contain only one element, `UnresolvedAttribute(ALL)`, which
   *     can't be resolved from current (nor from hidden output) - this is done using
   *     [[ResolveAsAllKeyword]], skip previous step and resolve it as an `ALL` keyword (by copying
   *     child's output and transforming it into attributes).
   *  4. In case there are attributes referenced in the order expressions are resolved using
   *     the hidden output (or in case we order by [[AggregateExpression]]s which are not present
   *     in [[Aggregate.aggregateExpressions]]) update the output of child operator and add a
   *     [[Project]] as a parent of [[Sort]] with original [[Project]]'s output (this is done by
   *     [[ResolvesNameByHiddenOutput]]). Query:
   *     {{{
   *     SELECT col1 FROM VALUES(1, 2) WHERE col2 > 2 ORDER BY col2;
   *     }}}
   *     Has the following unresolved plan:
   *
   *     'Sort ['col2 ASC NULLS FIRST], true
   *       +- 'Project ['col1]
   *         +- 'Filter ('col2 > 2)
   *           +- LocalRelation [col1#92225, col2#92226]
   *
   *     Because `col2` from the [[Sort]] node is resolved using the hidden output, add it to the
   *     [[Project.projectList]] and add a [[Project]] with original project list as a top node:
   *
   *     Project [col1]
   *       +- Sort [col2 ASC NULLS FIRST], true
   *         +- Project [col1, col2]
   *           +- Filter (col2 > 2)
   *             +- LocalRelation [col1, col2]
   *
   *     Another example with ordering by [[AggregateExpression]]:
   *     {{{
   *     SELECT col1 FROM VALUES (1, 2) GROUP BY col1, col2 + 1 ORDER BY SUM(col1), col2 + 1;
   *     }}}
   *     Has the following unresolved plan:
   *
   *     'Sort ['SUM('col1) ASC NULLS FIRST, ('col2 + 1) ASC NULLS FIRST], true
   *       +- 'Aggregate ['col1, ('col2 + 1)], ['col1]
   *         +- LocalRelation [col1, col2]
   *
   *     Because neither `SUM(col1)` nor `col2 + 1` from the [[Sort]] node are present in the
   *     [[Aggregate.aggregateExpressions]], add them to it and add a [[Project]] with original
   *     project list as a top node (`SUM(col2)` is extracted in the
   *     [[AggregateExpressionResolver]] whereas `col2 + 1` is extracted using
   *     `extractReferencedGroupingAndAggregateExpressions` helper method):
   *
   *     Project [col1]
   *       +- Sort [sum(col1)#... ASC NULLS FIRST, (col2 + 1)#... ASC NULLS FIRST], true
   *         +- Aggregate [col1, (col2 + 1)],
   *                      [col1, sum(col1) AS sum(col1)#..., (col2 + 1) AS (col2 + 1)#...]
   *           +- LocalRelation [col1, col2]
