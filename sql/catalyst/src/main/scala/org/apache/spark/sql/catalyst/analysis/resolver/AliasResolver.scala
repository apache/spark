   * cleanup aliases after the analyzer
   * resolves auto generated names. For example:
   * {{{

   * resulting [[Alias]]. In case result of the [[AliasResolution]] call is an [[OuterReference]],
   * we create a new [[Alias]] using the [[AutoGeneratedAliasProvider]]. Here we allow inner
   * aliases to persist until the end of single-pass resolution, after which they will be removed
   * in the post-processing phase.
   *
   * Resulting [[Alias]] must be added to the list of `availableAliases` in the current
   * [[NameScope]].
