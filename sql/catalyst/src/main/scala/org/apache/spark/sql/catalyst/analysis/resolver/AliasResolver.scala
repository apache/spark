   * [[CreateNamedStruct]] to be computed before removing inner aliases.

   *    +- 'UnresolvedRelation [t], [], false
   *
   * After resolving, the expected column name in fixed-point schema is:
   *
   * named_struct(out1, semi_structured_extract_json_multi(col1.a, $.b.c) AS c AS out1, out2, semi_structured_extract_json_multi(col1.a, $.b.d) AS d AS out2
