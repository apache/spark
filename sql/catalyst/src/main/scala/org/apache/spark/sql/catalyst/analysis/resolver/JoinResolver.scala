  /**
   * This method handles [[NaturalJoin]] and [[UsingJoin]] by computing their correct outputs and

   * The order of necessary operations is as follows:
   *  - Compute output list, hidden list and new condition with join pairs, if there are any.
   *    [[NaturalAndUsingJoinResolution.computeJoinOutputsAndNewCondition]] introduces new
   *    aliased expressions (e.g. [[Coalesce]] for keys), so we need to run the output list through
   *    [[ExpressionIdAssigner.mapExpression]].
   *  - Resolve the new condition.
   *  - Compute new `hiddenOutput` by appending elements from computed hidden list that are not
   *  already in current `hiddenOutput`. Hidden list must be qualified access only.
   *  - Overwrite current name scope with output list and newly computed hidden output.
   *  - Finally, put a [[Project]] node on top of the original [[Join]] by:
   *    - New project list becomes output list.
   *    - If [[Join]] was not a top level operator, append current hidden output to the project
   *    list.
   *    - Add qualified access only attributes from new hidden output as a tag to project node in
   *    order to stay compatible with fixed-point. This should never be used in single-pass, but it
   *    can happen that fixed-point uses the single-pass result, therefore we need to set the tag.
