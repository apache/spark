/**
 * [[ExpressionIdAssigner]] is used by the [[ExpressionResolver]] to assign unique expression IDs to
 * [[NamedExpression]]s ([[AttributeReference]]s and [[Alias]]es). This is necessary to ensure
 * that Optimizer performs its work correctly and does not produce correctness issues.
 *
 * The framework works the following way:
 *  - Each leaf operator must have globally unique output IDs (even if it's the same table, view,
 *    or CTE).
 *  - The [[AttributeReference]]s get propagated "upwards" through the operator tree with their IDs
 *    preserved. In case of correlated subqueries [[AttributeReference]]s may propagate downwards
 *    from the outer scope to the point of correlated reference in the subquery. Currently only
 *    one level of correlation is supported.
 *  - Each [[Alias]] gets assigned a new globally unique ID and it sticks with it after it gets
 *    converted to an [[AttributeReference]] when it is outputted from the operator that produced
 *    it.
 *  - Any operator may have [[AttributeReference]]s with the same IDs in its output given it is the
 *    same attribute.
 * Thus, **no multi-child operator may have children with conflicting [[AttributeReference]] IDs**.
 * In other words, two subtrees must not output the [[AttributeReference]]s with the same IDs, since
 * relations, views and CTEs all output unique attributes, and [[Alias]]es get assigned new IDs as
 * well. [[ExpressionIdAssigner.assertOutputsHaveNoConflictingExpressionIds]] is used to assert this
 * invariant.
 *
 * For SQL queries, this framework provides correctness just by reallocating relation outputs and
 * by validating the invariants mentioned above. Reallocation is done in
 * [[Resolver.handleLeafOperator]]. If all the relations (even if it's the same table) have unique
 * output IDs, the expression ID assignment will be correct, because there are no duplicate IDs in
 * a pure unresolved tree. The old ID -> new ID mapping is not needed in this case.
 * For example, consider this query:
 *
 * {{{
 * SELECT * FROM t AS t1 CROSS JOIN t AS t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1
 * }}}
 *
 * The analyzed plan should be:
 * {{{
 * Project [col1#0, col2#1, col1#2, col2#3]
 * +- Join Cross, (col1#0 = col1#2)
 *    :- SubqueryAlias t1
 *    :   +- Relation t[col1#0,col2#1] parquet
 *    +- SubqueryAlias t2
 *        +- Relation t[col1#2,col2#3] parquet
 * }}}
 *
 * and not:
 * {{{
 * Project [col1#0, col2#1, col1#0, col2#1]
 * +- Join Cross, (col1#0 = col1#0)
 *    :- SubqueryAlias t1
 *    :   +- Relation t[col1#0,col2#1] parquet
 *    +- SubqueryAlias t2
 *        +- Relation t[col1#0,col2#1] parquet
 * }}}
 *
 * Because in the latter case the join condition is always true.
 *
 * For DataFrame programs we need the full power of [[ExpressionIdAssigner]], and old ID -> new ID
 * mapping comes in handy, because DataFrame programs pass _partially_ resolved plans to the
 * [[Resolver]], which may consist of duplicate subtrees, and thus will have already assigned
 * expression IDs. These already resolved duplicate subtrees with assigned IDs will conflict.
 * Hence, we need to reallocate all the leaf node outputs _and_ remap old IDs to the new ones.
 * Also, DataFrame programs may introduce the same [[Alias]]es in different parts of the query plan,
 * so we just reallocate all the [[Alias]]es.
 *
 * For example, consider this DataFrame program:
 *
 * {{{
 * spark.range(0, 10).select($"id").write.format("parquet").saveAsTable("t")
 * val alias = ($"id" + 1).as("id")
 * spark.table("t").select(alias).select(alias)
 * }}}
 *
 * The analyzed plan should be:
 * {{{
 * Project [(id#6L + cast(1 as bigint)) AS id#13L]
 * +- Project [(id#4L + cast(1 as bigint)) AS id#6L]
 *    +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t
 *       +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[id#4L] parquet
 * }}}
 *
 * and not:
 * {{{
 * Project [(id#6L + cast(1 as bigint)) AS id#6L]
 * +- Project [(id#4L + cast(1 as bigint)) AS id#6L]
 *    +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t
 *       +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t[id#4L] parquet
 * }}}
 *
 * Because the latter case will confuse the Optimizer and the top [[Project]] will be eliminated
 * leading to incorrect result.
 *
 * In case of partially resolved DataFrame subtrees with correlated subqueries inside we need to
 * remap [[OuterReference]]s as well:
 *
 * {{{
 * val df = spark.sql("""
 *   SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (
 *     SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t2.id == t1.id
 *   )
 * """)
 * df.union(df)
 * }}}
 *
 * The analyzed plan should be:
 * {{{
 * Union false, false
 * :- Project [id#1]
 * :  +- Filter exists#9 [id#1]
 * :     :  +- Project [id#16]
 * :     :     +- Filter (id#16 = outer(id#1))
 * :     :        +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t2
 * :     :           +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t2[id#16] parquet
 * :     +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t1
 * :        +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t1[id#1] parquet
 * +- Project [id#17 AS id#19]
 *    +- Project [id#17]
 *       +- Filter exists#9 [id#17]
 *          :  +- Project [id#18]
 *          :     +- Filter (id#18 = outer(id#17))
 *          :        +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t2
 *          :           +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t2[id#18] parquet
 *          +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t1
 *             +- Relation spark_catalog.default.t1[id#17] parquet
 * }}}
 *
 * Note how id#17 is the same in outer branch and in a subquery - is was properly remapped, because
 * the right subtree of [[Union]] contained identical expression IDs as the left subtree. That's
 * why we pass main mapping as outer mapping to the correlated subquery branch.
 *
 * There's an important caveat here: those branches of a logical plan tree where outputs do not
 * conflict. We should preserve expression IDs on those branches wherever possible because
 * DataFrames may reference each other using their attributes. This also makes sense for
 * performance reasons.
 *
 * Consider this example:
 *
 * {{{
 * val df1 = spark.range(0, 10).select($"id")
 * val df2 = spark.range(5, 15).select($"id")
 * df1.union(df2).filter(df1("id") === 5)
 * }}}
 *
 * In this example `df("id")` references lower `id` attribute by expression ID, so `union` must not
 * reassign expression IDs in `df1` (left child). Referencing `df2` (right child) is not supported
 * in Spark, because [[Union]] does not output it, but we don't have to regenerate expression IDs
 * in that branch either.
 *
 * However:
 *
 * {{{
 * val df1 = spark.range(0, 10).select($"id")
 * df1.union(df1).filter(df1("id") === 5)
 * }}}
 *
 * Here we need to regenerate expression IDs in the right branch, because those would conflict
 * (both branches are the same plan). Expression IDs in the left branch may be preserved.
 *
 * CTE references are handled in a special way to stay compatible with the fixed-point Analyzer.
 * First [[CTERelationRef]] that we meet in the query plan can preserve its output expression IDs,
 * and the plan will be inlined by the [[InlineCTE]] without any artificial [[Alias]]es that
 * "stitch" expression IDs together. This way we ensure that Optimizer behavior is the same as
 * after the fixed-point Analyzer and that no extra projections are introduced.
 *
 * The [[ExpressionIdAssigner]] covers both SQL and DataFrame scenarios with single approach and is
 * integrated into the single-pass analysis framework.
 *
 * The [[ExpressionIdAssigner]] is used in the following way:
 *  - When the [[Resolver]] traverses the tree downwards prior to starting bottom-up analysis,
 *    we build the [[mappingStack]] by calling [[withNewMapping]] (i.e. [[mappingStack.push]])
 *    for every child of a multi-child operator, so we have a separate stack entry (separate
 *    mapping) for each branch. This way sibling branches' mappings are isolated from each other and
 *    attribute IDs are reused only within the same branch. Initially we push `None`, because
 *    the mapping needs to be initialized later with the correct output of a resolved operator.
 *  - When the bottom-up analysis starts, we assign IDs to all the [[NamedExpression]]s which are
 *    present in operators starting from the [[LeafNode]]s using [[mapExpression]].
 *    [[createMappingForLeafOperator]] is called right after each [[LeafNode]] is resolved, and
 *    first remapped attributes come from that [[LeafNode]]. This is done if leaf operator output
 *    doesn't conflict with `globalExpressionIds`.
 *  - Once the child branch is resolved, [[withNewMapping]] ends by calling [[mappingStack.pop]].
 *  - After the multi-child operator is resolved, we call [[createMappingFromChildMappings]] to
 *    initialize the mapping with attributes collected in [[withNewMapping]] with
 *    `collectChildMapping = true`.
 *  - While traversing the expression tree, we may meet a [[SubqueryExpression]] and resolve its
 *    plan. In this case we call [[withNewMapping]] with `isSubqueryRoot = true` to pass the
 *    current mapping as outer mapping to the subquery branches. Any subquery branch may reference
 *    outer attributes, so if `isSubqueryRoot` is `false`, we pass the previous `outerMapping` to
 *    lower branches. Since we only support one level of correlation, for every subquery level
 *    current `mapping` becomes `outerMapping` for the next level.
 *  - Continue remapping expressions until we reach the root of the operator tree.

   * left, because that's how operators like [[Union]] propagate IDs upwards.
   *
   * Example 1:
   * {{{
   * val df1 = spark.range(0, 10)
   * val df2 = df1.select(($"id" + 1).as("id"))

   *
   * // This succeeds because left branch IDs are preserved.
   * df3.where(df2("id") === 1)
   *
   * // This fails because right branch IDs are regenerated.
   * df3.where(df1("id") === 1)
   * }}}
   *
   * Example 2:
   * {{{
   * val df1 = spark.range(10).withColumn("a", lit(0))
   *
   * // "a" is aliased to "b" and gets a new expression ID.
   * val df2 = df1.withColumnRenamed("a", "b")
   *
   * // Both types of self-join work, despite the fact that they contain duplicate IDs for "a".
   * // This is because ExpressionIdAssigner knows that "a" is outputted from the "df1" branch,
   * // and therefore that mapping is the priority one.
   * df1.join(df2, df1("a") === df2("b"))
   * df2.join(df1, df2("b") === df1("a"))
   * }}}

   * 1) Preserve the name case. In Spark the "requested" name takes precedence over the "original"
   * name:
   *
   * {{{
   * -- The output schema is [col1, COL1]
   * SELECT col1, COL1 FROM VALUES (1);
   * }}}
   *
   * 2) Preserve the metadata:
   *
   * {{{
   * // Metadata "m1" remains, "m2" gets overwritten by the specified schema, "m3" is newly added.
   * val metadata1 = new MetadataBuilder().putString("m1", "1").putString("m2", "2").build()
   * val metadata2 = new MetadataBuilder().putString("m2", "3").putString("m3", "4").build()
   * val schema = new StructType().add("a", IntegerType, nullable = true, metadata = metadata2)
   * val df =

   * }}}
   *
   * When resolving partially resolved DataFrame plans, we sometimes may meet a duplicate
   * [[Alias]]. Every [[Alias]] in the logical plan has to have a unique expression ID. If those
   * aliases are not in the same mapping (different logical plan branches or different subqueries),
   * we can reallocate both and create mappings for each of those IDs, because those won't conflict
   * (the mappings are isolated). However, if we meet a duplicate alias in the same logical plan
   * branch, we need to decide which expression ID takes over, because there's a key clash in the
   * mapping (old -> new1, old -> new2). Usually we need the latter one, because, as in the example
   * from the class doc about a duplicate alias in different [[Project]]s, that is the one that
   * is referenced above. However, some parts of the logical plan do not leak any references
   * outside (nothing can be referenced from those parts). One example is grouping expression
   * in [[Aggregate]]. If groping expressions are created from a DataFrame API, they may contain
   * [[Alias]]es with the same IDs as in the related aggregate expressions. Since grouping
   * expressions are resolved after the aggregate expressions, we don't want the latter alias IDs
   * to take over. Hence, we set `prioritizeOldDuplicateAliasId` to `true` when resolving grouping
   * expressions and do not track the new alias, since it cannot be referenced again. And if this
   * alias is referenced for some reason, we will throw a "dangling attribute reference" error.
   *
   * In the following example Spark Connect DataFrames produce a duplicate alias mentioned above:
   * {{{
   * df.groupBy($"a", $"b".as("sum_d")).agg(Map.empty[String, String])
