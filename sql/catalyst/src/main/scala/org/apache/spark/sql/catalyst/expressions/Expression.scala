/**
 * An expression in Catalyst.
 *
 * If an expression wants to be exposed in the function registry (so users can call it with
 * "name(arguments...)", the concrete implementation must be a case class whose constructor
 * arguments are all Expressions types. See [[Substring]] for an example.
 *
 * There are a few important traits or abstract classes:
 *
 * - [[Nondeterministic]]: an expression that is not deterministic.
 * - [[Stateful]]: an expression that contains mutable state. For example, MonotonicallyIncreasingID
 *                 and Rand. A stateful expression is always non-deterministic.
 * - [[Unevaluable]]: an expression that is not supposed to be evaluated.
 * - [[CodegenFallback]]: an expression that does not have code gen implemented and falls back to
 *                        interpreted mode.
 * - [[NullIntolerant]]: an expression that is null intolerant (i.e. any null input will result in
 *                       null output).
 * - [[NonSQLExpression]]: a common base trait for the expressions that do not have SQL
 *                         expressions like representation. For example, `ScalaUDF`, `ScalaUDAF`,
 *                         and object `MapObjects` and `Invoke`.
 * - [[UserDefinedExpression]]: a common base trait for user-defined functions, including
 *                              UDF/UDAF/UDTF.
 * - [[HigherOrderFunction]]: a common base trait for higher order functions that take one or more
 *                            (lambda) functions and applies these to some objects. The function
 *                            produces a number of variables which can be consumed by some lambda
 *                            functions.
 * - [[NamedExpression]]: An [[Expression]] that is named.
 * - [[TimeZoneAwareExpression]]: A common base trait for time zone aware expressions.
 * - [[SubqueryExpression]]: A base interface for expressions that contain a
 *                           [[org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan]].
 *
 * - [[LeafExpression]]: an expression that has no child.
 * - [[UnaryExpression]]: an expression that has one child.
 * - [[BinaryExpression]]: an expression that has two children.
 * - [[TernaryExpression]]: an expression that has three children.
 * - [[QuaternaryExpression]]: an expression that has four children.
 * - [[BinaryOperator]]: a special case of [[BinaryExpression]] that requires two children to have
 *                       the same output data type.
 *
 * A few important traits used for type coercion rules:
 * - [[ExpectsInputTypes]]: an expression that has the expected input types. This trait is typically
 *                          used by operator expressions (e.g. [[Add]], [[Subtract]]) to define
 *                          expected input types without any implicit casting.
 * - [[ImplicitCastInputTypes]]: an expression that has the expected input types, which can be
 *                               implicitly castable using [[TypeCoercion.ImplicitTypeCasts]].
 * - [[ComplexTypeMergingExpression]]: to resolve output types of the complex expressions
 *                                     (e.g., [[CaseWhen]]).

   * - it assumes the input satisfies some certain condition via the child operator.
