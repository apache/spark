/**
 * A resolver for [[UnresolvedFunction]]s that resolves functions to concrete [[Expression]]s.
 * It resolves the children of the function first by calling [[ExpressionResolver.resolve]] on them
 * if they are not [[UnresolvedStar]]s. If the children are [[UnresolvedStar]]s, it resolves them
 * using [[ExpressionResolver.resolveStar]]. Examples are following:
 *
 *  - Function doesn't contain any [[UnresolvedStar]]:
 *  {{{ SELECT ARRAY(col1) FROM VALUES (1); }}}
 *  it is resolved only using [[ExpressionResolver.resolve]].
 *  - Function contains [[UnresolvedStar]]:
 *  {{{ SELECT ARRAY(*) FROM VALUES (1); }}}
 *  it is resolved using [[ExpressionResolver.resolveStar]].
 *
 * After resolving the function with [[FunctionResolution.resolveFunction]] specific expression
 * nodes require further resolution. See [[resolve]] for more details.
 *
 * Finally apply type coercion to the result of previous step and in case that the resulting
 * expression is [[TimeZoneAwareExpression]], apply timezone.

  /**
   * Main method used to resolve an [[UnresolvedFunction]]. It resolves it in the following steps:
   *  - Check if the `unresolvedFunction` is an aggregate expression. Set
   *    `resolvingTreeUnderAggregateExpression` to `true` in that case so we can properly resolve
   *    attributes in ORDER BY and HAVING.
   *  - If the function is `count(*)` it is replaced with `count(1)` (please check
   *    [[normalizeCountExpression]] documentation for more details). Otherwise, we resolve the
   *    children of it.
   *  - Resolve the function using [[FunctionResolution.resolveFunction]].
   *  - Perform further resolution on specific nodes:
   *    - Initialize the seed of [[InheritAnalysisRules]];
   *    - Resolve the replacement expression of [[InheritAnalysisRules]];
   *    - Type coerce [[TryEval]]'s child. Copying tags is specifically important for
   *      [[FunctionRegistry.FUNC_ALIAS]];
   *    - Use [[AggregateExpressionResolver]] to resolve [[AggregateExpression]];
   *    - Use [[BinaryArithmeticResolver]] to resolve [[BinaryArithmetic]]. Specifically important
   *      for cases like:
   *      - {{{ SELECT `+`(1,2); }}}
   *      - df.select(1+2)
   *  - Apply [[TypeCoercion]] rules to the result of previous step. In case that the resulting
   *    expression of the previous step is [[BinaryArithmetic]], skip this one as type coercion is
   *    already applied.
   *  - Apply timezone, if the resulting expression is [[TimeZoneAwareExpression]].
