# INSTALL / BUILD instructions for Apache Airflow

This ia a generic installation method that requires a number of dependencies to be installed.

Depending on your system you might need different prerequisites, but the following
systems/prerequisites are known to work:

Linux (Debian Buster and Linux Mint Tricia):

sudo apt install build-essentials python3.6-dev python3.7-dev python-dev openssl \
                 sqlite sqlite-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev libmysqld-dev postgresq

MacOS (Mojave/Catalina):

brew install sqlite mysql postgresql

# [required] fetch the tarball and untar the source move into the directory that was untarred.

# [optional] run Apache RAT (release audit tool) to validate license headers
# RAT docs here: https://creadur.apache.org/rat/. Requires Java and Apache Rat
java -jar apache-rat.jar -E ./.rat-excludes -d .

# [optional] Airflow pulls in quite a lot of dependencies in order
# to connect to other services. You might want to test or run Airflow
# from a virtual env to make sure those dependencies are separated
# from your system wide versions

python3 -m venv PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV
source PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV/bin/activate

# [required] building and installing by pip (preferred)
pip install .

# or directly
python setup.py install

# You can also install recommended version of the dependencies by using
# constraint-python<PYTHON_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION>.txt files as constraint file. This is needed in case
# you have problems with installing the current requirements from PyPI.
# There are different constraint files for different python versions. For example"

pip install . \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-master/constraints-3.6.txt"

# You can also install Airflow with extras specified. The list of available extras:
