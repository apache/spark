 * Counts words in text encoded with UTF8 received from the network every second.

 * Usage: NetworkWordCount <master> <hostname> <port>
 *   <master> is the Spark master URL. In local mode, <master> should be 'local[n]' with n > 1.
 *   <hostname> and <port> describe the TCP server that Spark Streaming would connect to receive data.
 *
 * To run this on your local machine, you need to first run a Netcat server
