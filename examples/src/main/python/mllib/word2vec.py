# This example uses text8 file from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip
# The file was downloaded, unzipped and split into multiple lines using
#
# wget http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip
# unzip text8.zip
# grep -o -E '\w+(\W+\w+){0,15}' text8 > text8_lines
# This was done so that the example can be run in local mode
