 Counts words in text encoded with UTF8 received from the network every second.

 Usage: recoverable_network_wordcount.py <hostname> <port> <checkpoint-directory> <output-file>
   <hostname> and <port> describe the TCP server that Spark Streaming would connect to receive
   data. <checkpoint-directory> directory to HDFS-compatible file system which checkpoint data
   <output-file> file to which the word counts will be appended

 To run this on your local machine, you need to first run a Netcat server
    `$ nc -lk 9999`

 and then run the example
    `$ bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/streaming/recoverable_network_wordcount.py \
        localhost 9999 ~/checkpoint/ ~/out`

 If the directory ~/checkpoint/ does not exist (e.g. running for the first time), it will create
 a new StreamingContext (will print "Creating new context" to the console). Otherwise, if
 checkpoint data exists in ~/checkpoint/, then it will create StreamingContext from
 the checkpoint data.
