There are several ways to monitor Spark applications: web UIs, metrics, and external instrumentation.

# Web Interfaces

Every SparkContext launches a [Web UI](web-ui.html), by default on port 4040, that
displays useful information about the application. This includes:

* A list of scheduler stages and tasks
* A summary of RDD sizes and memory usage
* Environmental information.
* Information about the running executors

You can access this interface by simply opening `http://<driver-node>:4040` in a web browser.
If multiple SparkContexts are running on the same host, they will bind to successive ports
beginning with 4040 (4041, 4042, etc).

Note that this information is only available for the duration of the application by default.
To view the web UI after the fact, set `spark.eventLog.enabled` to true before starting the
application. This configures Spark to log Spark events that encode the information displayed
in the UI to persisted storage.

## Viewing After the Fact

It is still possible to construct the UI of an application through Spark's history server,
provided that the application's event logs exist.
You can start the history server by executing:

    ./sbin/start-history-server.sh

This creates a web interface at `http://<server-url>:18080` by default, listing incomplete
and completed applications and attempts.

When using the file-system provider class (see `spark.history.provider` below), the base logging
directory must be supplied in the `spark.history.fs.logDirectory` configuration option,
and should contain sub-directories that each represents an application's event logs.

The spark jobs themselves must be configured to log events, and to log them to the same shared,
writable directory. For example, if the server was configured with a log directory of
`hdfs://namenode/shared/spark-logs`, then the client-side options would be:

    spark.eventLog.enabled true
    spark.eventLog.dir hdfs://namenode/shared/spark-logs

The history server can be configured as follows:

### Environment Variables

### Applying compaction on rolling event log files

A long-running application (e.g. streaming) can bring a huge single event log file which may cost a lot to maintain and
also requires a bunch of resource to replay per each update in Spark History Server.

Enabling <code>spark.eventLog.rolling.enabled</code> and <code>spark.eventLog.rolling.maxFileSize</code> would
let you have rolling event log files instead of single huge event log file which may help some scenarios on its own,
but it still doesn't help you reducing the overall size of logs.

Spark History Server can apply compaction on the rolling event log files to reduce the overall size of
logs, via setting the configuration <code>spark.history.fs.eventLog.rolling.maxFilesToRetain</code> on the
Spark History Server.

Details will be described below, but please note in prior that compaction is LOSSY operation.
Compaction will discard some events which will be no longer seen on UI - you may want to check which events will be discarded
before enabling the option.

When the compaction happens, the History Server lists all the available event log files for the application, and considers
the event log files having less index than the file with smallest index which will be retained as target of compaction.
For example, if the application A has 5 event log files and <code>spark.history.fs.eventLog.rolling.maxFilesToRetain</code> is set to 2, then first 3 log files will be selected to be compacted.

Once it selects the target, it analyzes them to figure out which events can be excluded, and rewrites them
into one compact file with discarding events which are decided to exclude.

The compaction tries to exclude the events which point to the outdated data. As of now, below describes the candidates of events to be excluded:

* Events for the job which is finished, and related stage/tasks events
* Events for the executor which is terminated
* Events for the SQL execution which is finished, and related job/stage/tasks events

Once rewriting is done, original log files will be deleted, via best-effort manner. The History Server may not be able to delete
the original log files, but it will not affect the operation of the History Server.

Please note that Spark History Server may not compact the old event log files if figures out not a lot of space
would be reduced during compaction. For streaming query we normally expect compaction
will run as each micro-batch will trigger one or more jobs which will be finished shortly, but compaction won't run
in many cases for batch query.

Please also note that this is a new feature introduced in Spark 3.0, and may not be completely stable. Under some circumstances,
the compaction may exclude more events than you expect, leading some UI issues on History Server for the application.
Use it with caution.

### Spark History Server Configuration Options

Security options for the Spark History Server are covered more detail in the
[Security](security.html#web-ui) page.

Note that in all of these UIs, the tables are sortable by clicking their headers,
making it easy to identify slow tasks, data skew, etc.

Note

1. The history server displays both completed and incomplete Spark jobs. If an application makes
multiple attempts after failures, the failed attempts will be displayed, as well as any ongoing
incomplete attempt or the final successful attempt.

1. Incomplete applications are only updated intermittently. The time between updates is defined
by the interval between checks for changed files (`spark.history.fs.update.interval`).
On larger clusters, the update interval may be set to large values.
The way to view a running application is actually to view its own web UI.

1. Applications which exited without registering themselves as completed will be listed
as incomplete —even though they are no longer running. This can happen if an application
crashes.

1. One way to signal the completion of a Spark job is to stop the Spark Context
explicitly (`sc.stop()`), or in Python using the `with SparkContext() as sc:` construct
to handle the Spark Context setup and tear down.


## REST API

In addition to viewing the metrics in the UI, they are also available as JSON.  This gives developers
an easy way to create new visualizations and monitoring tools for Spark.  The JSON is available for
both running applications, and in the history server.  The endpoints are mounted at `/api/v1`.  For example,
for the history server, they would typically be accessible at `http://<server-url>:18080/api/v1`, and
for a running application, at `http://localhost:4040/api/v1`.

In the API, an application is referenced by its application ID, `[app-id]`.
When running on YARN, each application may have multiple attempts, but there are attempt IDs
only for applications in cluster mode, not applications in client mode. Applications in YARN cluster mode
can be identified by their `[attempt-id]`. In the API listed below, when running in YARN cluster mode,
`[app-id]` will actually be `[base-app-id]/[attempt-id]`, where `[base-app-id]` is the YARN application ID.

The number of jobs and stages which can be retrieved is constrained by the same retention
mechanism of the standalone Spark UI; `"spark.ui.retainedJobs"` defines the threshold
value triggering garbage collection on jobs, and `spark.ui.retainedStages` that for stages.
Note that the garbage collection takes place on playback: it is possible to retrieve
more entries by increasing these values and restarting the history server.

### Executor Metrics

Executor-level metrics are sent from each executor to the driver as part of the Heartbeat to describe the performance metrics of Executor itself like JVM heap memory, GC information.
Executor metric values and their measured memory peak values per executor are exposed via the REST API in JSON format and in Prometheus format.
The JSON end point is exposed at: `/applications/[app-id]/executors`, and the Prometheus endpoint at: `/metrics/executors/prometheus`.
In addition, aggregated per-stage peak values of the executor memory metrics are written to the event log if
`spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorMetrics` is true.
Executor memory metrics are also exposed via the Spark metrics system based on the [Dropwizard metrics library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0).

### API Versioning Policy

These endpoints have been strongly versioned to make it easier to develop applications on top.
 In particular, Spark guarantees:

* Endpoints will never be removed from one version
* Individual fields will never be removed for any given endpoint
* New endpoints may be added
* New fields may be added to existing endpoints
* New versions of the api may be added in the future as a separate endpoint (e.g., `api/v2`).  New versions are *not* required to be backwards compatible.
* Api versions may be dropped, but only after at least one minor release of co-existing with a new api version.

Note that even when examining the UI of running applications, the `applications/[app-id]` portion is
still required, though there is only one application available.  E.g. to see the list of jobs for the
running app, you would go to `http://localhost:4040/api/v1/applications/[app-id]/jobs`.  This is to
keep the paths consistent in both modes.

# Metrics

Spark has a configurable metrics system based on the
[Dropwizard Metrics Library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0).
This allows users to report Spark metrics to a variety of sinks including HTTP, JMX, and CSV
files. The metrics are generated by sources embedded in the Spark code base. They
provide instrumentation for specific activities and Spark components.
The metrics system is configured via a configuration file that Spark expects to be present
at `$SPARK_HOME/conf/metrics.properties`. A custom file location can be specified via the
`spark.metrics.conf` [configuration property](configuration.html#spark-properties).
Instead of using the configuration file, a set of configuration parameters with prefix
`spark.metrics.conf.` can be used.
By default, the root namespace used for driver or executor metrics is
the value of `spark.app.id`. However, often times, users want to be able to track the metrics
across apps for driver and executors, which is hard to do with application ID
(i.e. `spark.app.id`) since it changes with every invocation of the app. For such use cases,
a custom namespace can be specified for metrics reporting using `spark.metrics.namespace`
configuration property.
If, say, users wanted to set the metrics namespace to the name of the application, they
can set the `spark.metrics.namespace` property to a value like `${spark.app.name}`. This value is
then expanded appropriately by Spark and is used as the root namespace of the metrics system.
Non-driver and executor metrics are never prefixed with `spark.app.id`, nor does the
`spark.metrics.namespace` property have any such affect on such metrics.

Spark's metrics are decoupled into different
_instances_ corresponding to Spark components. Within each instance, you can configure a
set of sinks to which metrics are reported. The following instances are currently supported:

* `master`: The Spark standalone master process.
* `applications`: A component within the master which reports on various applications.
* `worker`: A Spark standalone worker process.
* `executor`: A Spark executor.
* `driver`: The Spark driver process (the process in which your SparkContext is created).
* `shuffleService`: The Spark shuffle service.
* `applicationMaster`: The Spark ApplicationMaster when running on YARN.

Each instance can report to zero or more _sinks_. Sinks are contained in the
`org.apache.spark.metrics.sink` package:

* `ConsoleSink`: Logs metrics information to the console.
* `CSVSink`: Exports metrics data to CSV files at regular intervals.
* `JmxSink`: Registers metrics for viewing in a JMX console.
* `MetricsServlet`: Adds a servlet within the existing Spark UI to serve metrics data as JSON data.
* `PrometheusServlet`: (Experimental) Adds a servlet within the existing Spark UI to serve metrics data in Prometheus format.
* `GraphiteSink`: Sends metrics to a Graphite node.
* `Slf4jSink`: Sends metrics to slf4j as log entries.
* `StatsdSink`: Sends metrics to a StatsD node.

The Prometheus Servlet mirrors the JSON data exposed by the <code>Metrics Servlet</code> and the REST API, but in a time-series format. The following are the equivalent Prometheus Servlet endpoints.   

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Port</th>
      <th>JSON End Point</th>
      <th>Prometheus End Point</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>8080</td>
    <td><code>/metrics/master/json/</code></td>
    <td><code>/metrics/master/prometheus/</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>8080</td>
    <td><code>/metrics/applications/json/</code></td>
    <td><code>/metrics/applications/prometheus/</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worker</td>
    <td>8081</td>
    <td><code>/metrics/json/</code></td>
    <td><code>/metrics/prometheus/</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Driver</td>
    <td>4040</td>
    <td><code>/metrics/json/</code></td>
    <td><code>/metrics/prometheus/</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Driver</td>
    <td>4040</td>
    <td><code>/api/v1/applications/{id}/executors/</code></td>
    <td><code>/metrics/executors/prometheus/</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Spark also supports a Ganglia sink which is not included in the default build due to
licensing restrictions:

* `GangliaSink`: Sends metrics to a Ganglia node or multicast group.

To install the `GangliaSink` you'll need to perform a custom build of Spark. _**Note that
by embedding this library you will include [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html)-licensed
code in your Spark package**_. For sbt users, set the
`SPARK_GANGLIA_LGPL` environment variable before building. For Maven users, enable
the `-Pspark-ganglia-lgpl` profile. In addition to modifying the cluster's Spark build
user applications will need to link to the `spark-ganglia-lgpl` artifact.

The syntax of the metrics configuration file and the parameters available for each sink are defined
in an example configuration file,
`$SPARK_HOME/conf/metrics.properties.template`.

When using Spark configuration parameters instead of the metrics configuration file, the relevant
parameter names are composed by the prefix `spark.metrics.conf.` followed by the configuration
details, i.e. the parameters take the following form:
`spark.metrics.conf.[instance|*].sink.[sink_name].[parameter_name]`.
This example shows a list of Spark configuration parameters for a Graphite sink:
```
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GraphiteSink"
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.host"="graphiteEndPoint_hostName>"
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.port"=<graphite_listening_port>
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.period"=10
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.unit"=seconds
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.prefix"="optional_prefix"
"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.graphite.regex"="optional_regex_to_send_matching_metrics"
```

Default values of the Spark metrics configuration are as follows:
```
"*.sink.servlet.class" = "org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.MetricsServlet"
"*.sink.servlet.path" = "/metrics/json"
"master.sink.servlet.path" = "/metrics/master/json"
"applications.sink.servlet.path" = "/metrics/applications/json"
```

Additional sources can be configured using the metrics configuration file or the configuration
parameter `spark.metrics.conf.[component_name].source.jvm.class=[source_name]`. At present the
JVM source is the only available optional source. For example the following configuration parameter
activates the JVM source:
`"spark.metrics.conf.*.source.jvm.class"="org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource"`

## List of available metrics providers

Metrics used by Spark are of multiple types: gauge, counter, histogram, meter and timer,
see [Dropwizard library documentation for details](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0/getting-started.html).
The following list of components and metrics reports the name and some details about the available metrics,
grouped per component instance and source namespace.
The most common time of metrics used in Spark instrumentation are gauges and counters.
Counters can be recognized as they have the `.count` suffix. Timers, meters and histograms are annotated
in the list, the rest of the list elements are metrics of type gauge.
The large majority of metrics are active as soon as their parent component instance is configured,
some metrics require also to be enabled via an additional configuration parameter, the details are

### Source = JVM Source
Notes:
  - Activate this source by setting the relevant `metrics.properties` file entry or the
  configuration parameter:`spark.metrics.conf.*.source.jvm.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource`
  - These metrics are conditional to a configuration parameter:
    `spark.metrics.staticSources.enabled` (default is true)
  - This source is available for driver and executor instances and is also available for other instances.
  - This source provides information on JVM metrics using the
  [Dropwizard/Codahale Metric Sets for JVM instrumentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.2.0/manual/jvm.html)
   and in particular the metric sets BufferPoolMetricSet, GarbageCollectorMetricSet and MemoryUsageGaugeSet.

- **note:** the metrics below apply when the server side configuration
  `spark.shuffle.push.server.mergedShuffleFileManagerImpl` is set to
  `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.MergedShuffleFileManager` for Push-Based Shuffle
- blockBytesWritten - size of the pushed block data written to file in bytes
- blockAppendCollisions - number of shuffle push blocks collided in shuffle services
  as another block for the same reduce partition were being written
- lateBlockPushes - number of shuffle push blocks that are received in shuffle service
  after the specific shuffle merge has been finalized
- deferredBlocks - number of the current deferred block parts buffered in memory
- deferredBlockBytes - size of the current deferred block parts buffered in memory
- staleBlockPushes - number of stale shuffle block push requests
- ignoredBlockBytes - size of the pushed block data that was transferred to ESS, but ignored.
  The pushed block data are considered as ignored when: 1. it was received after the shuffle
  was finalized; 2. when a push request is for a duplicate block; 3. ESS was unable to write the block.

# Advanced Instrumentation

Several external tools can be used to help profile the performance of Spark jobs:

* Cluster-wide monitoring tools, such as [Ganglia](http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/), can provide
insight into overall cluster utilization and resource bottlenecks. For instance, a Ganglia
dashboard can quickly reveal whether a particular workload is disk bound, network bound, or
CPU bound.
* OS profiling tools such as [dstat](http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/),
[iostat](http://linux.die.net/man/1/iostat), and [iotop](http://linux.die.net/man/1/iotop)
can provide fine-grained profiling on individual nodes.
* JVM utilities such as `jstack` for providing stack traces, `jmap` for creating heap-dumps,
`jstat` for reporting time-series statistics and `jconsole` for visually exploring various JVM
properties are useful for those comfortable with JVM internals.

Spark also provides a plugin API so that custom instrumentation code can be added to Spark
applications. There are two configuration keys available for loading plugins into Spark:

- <code>spark.plugins</code>
- <code>spark.plugins.defaultList</code>

Both take a comma-separated list of class names that implement the
<code>org.apache.spark.api.plugin.SparkPlugin</code> interface. The two names exist so that it's
possible for one list to be placed in the Spark default config file, allowing users to
easily add other plugins from the command line without overwriting the config file's list. Duplicate
plugins are ignored.
