Package apache-airflow-providers-apache-druid
------------------------------------------------------

`Apache Druid <https://druid.apache.org/>`__.


Release: 1.0.1

Provider package
----------------

This is a provider package for ``apache.druid`` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in ``airflow.providers.apache.druid`` python package.

Installation
------------

.. note::

    On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
    does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might lead to errors in installation - depends on your choice
    of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
    ``pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4`` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
    ``--use-deprecated legacy-resolver`` to your pip install command.


You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
``pip install apache-airflow-providers-apache-druid``
