Recipes
=======

Users sometimes share interesting ways of using the Docker images. We encourage users to contribute these
recipes to the documentation in case they prove useful to other members of the community by
submitting a pull request. The sections below capture this knowledge.

Google Cloud SDK installation
-----------------------------

Some operators, such as :class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.kubernetes_engine.GKEStartPodOperator`,
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow.DataflowStartSqlJobOperator`, require
the installation of `Google Cloud SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk>`__ (includes ``gcloud``).
You can also run these commands with BashOperator.

Create a new Dockerfile like the one shown below.

.. exampleinclude:: /docker-images-recipes/gcloud.Dockerfile
    :language: dockerfile

Then build a new image.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --pull \
    --build-arg BASE_AIRFLOW_IMAGE="apache/airflow:2.0.2" \
    --tag my-airflow-image:0.0.1


Apache Hadoop Stack installation
--------------------------------

Airflow is often used to run tasks on Hadoop cluster. It required Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run.
Below are the steps to take tools that are frequently used in Hadoop-world:

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Hive
- `Cloud Storage connector for Apache Hadoop <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage>`__


Create a new Dockerfile like the one shown below.

.. exampleinclude:: /docker-images-recipes/hadoop.Dockerfile
    :language: dockerfile

Then build a new image.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --pull \
    --build-arg BASE_AIRFLOW_IMAGE="apache/airflow:2.0.2" \
    --tag my-airflow-image:0.0.1
