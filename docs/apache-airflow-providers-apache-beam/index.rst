Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integration with the ``google`` provider
````````````````````````````````````````

In 2.0.0 version of the provider we've changed the way of integrating with the ``google`` provider.
The previous versions of both providers caused conflicts when trying to install them together
using PIP > 20.2.4. The conflict is not detected by PIP 20.2.4 and below but it was there and
the version of ``Google BigQuery`` python client was not matching on both sides. As the result, when
both ``apache.beam`` and ``google`` provider were installed, some features of the ``BigQuery`` operators
might not work properly. This was cause by ``apache-beam`` client not yet supporting the new google
python clients when ``apache-beam[gcp]`` extra was used. The ``apache-beam[gcp]`` extra is used
by ``Dataflow`` operators and while they might work with the newer version of the ``Google BigQuery``
python client, it is not guaranteed.

This version introduces additional extra requirement for the ``apache.beam`` extra of the ``google`` provider
and symmetrically the additional requirement for the ``google`` extra of the ``apache.beam`` provider.
Both ``google`` and ``apache.beam`` provider do not use those extras by default, but you can specify
them when installing the providers. The consequence of that is that some functionality of the ``Dataflow``
operators might not be available.

Unfortunately the only ``complete`` solution to the problem is for the ``apache.beam`` to migrate to the
new (>=2.0.0) Google Python clients.

This is the extra for the ``google`` provider:

.. code-block:: python

        extras_require={
            ...
            'apache.beam': ['apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam', 'apache-beam[gcp]'],
            ....
        },

And likewise this is the extra for the ``apache.beam`` provider:

.. code-block:: python

        extras_require={'google': ['apache-airflow-providers-google', 'apache-beam[gcp]']},

You can still run this with PIP version <= 20.2.4 and go back to the previous behaviour:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install apache-airflow-providers-google[apache.beam]

or

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam[google]

But be aware that some ``BigQuery`` operators functionality might not be available in this case.
