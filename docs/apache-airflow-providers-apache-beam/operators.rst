Apache Beam Operators
=====================

`Apache Beam <https://beam.apache.org/>`__ is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and
streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program
that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beam’s supported distributed processing
back-ends, which include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.


.. _howto/operator:BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator:

Run Python Pipelines in Apache Beam
===================================

The ``py_file`` argument must be specified for
:class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator`
as it contains the pipeline to be executed by Beam. The Python file can be available on GCS that Airflow
has the ability to download or available on the local filesystem (provide the absolute path to it).

The ``py_interpreter`` argument specifies the Python version to be used when executing the pipeline, the default
is ``python3`. If your Airflow instance is running on Python 2 - specify ``python2`` and ensure your ``py_file`` is
in Python 2. For best results, use Python 3.

If ``py_requirements`` argument is specified a temporary Python virtual environment with specified requirements will be created
and within it pipeline will run.

The ``py_system_site_packages`` argument specifies whether or not all the Python packages from your Airflow instance,
will be accessible within virtual environment (if ``py_requirements`` argument is specified),
recommend avoiding unless the Dataflow job requires it.

Run Java Pipelines in Apache Beam
=================================

For Java pipeline the ``jar`` argument must be specified for
:class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator`
as it contains the pipeline to be executed by Apache Beam. The JAR can be available on GCS that Airflow
has the ability to download or available on the local filesystem (provide the absolute path to it).
