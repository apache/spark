Kubernetes cluster Connection
=============================

The Kubernetes cluster Connection type enables connection to Kubernetes cluster.


Authenticating to Kubernetes cluster
------------------------------------

There are three ways to connect to Kubernetes using Airflow.

1. Use kube_config that reside in the default location on the machine(~/.kube/config) - just leave all fields empty.
2. Use in_cluster config, if Airflow runs inside Kubernetes cluster take the configuration from the cluster - mark:
   In cluster configuration .
3. Use kube_config in JSON format from connection configuration - paste  kube_config into ``Kube config (JSON format)`` .

Default Connection IDs
