Hashicorp Vault Secrets Backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Hashicorp vault to retrieve Airflow connection/variable, specify :py:class:`~airflow.providers.hashicorp.secrets.vault.VaultBackend`
as the ``backend`` in  ``[secrets]`` section of ``airflow.cfg``.

Here is a sample configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.hashicorp.secrets.vault.VaultBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_path": "connections", "variables_path": "variables", "mount_point": "airflow", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8200"}

The default KV version engine is ``2``, pass ``kv_engine_version: 1`` in ``backend_kwargs`` if you use
KV Secrets Engine Version ``1``.

You can also set and pass values to Vault client by setting environment variables. All the
environment variables listed at https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables are supported.

Hence, if you set ``VAULT_ADDR`` environment variable like below, you do not need to pass ``url``
key to ``backend_kwargs``:

.. code-block:: bash

    export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"


Storing and Retrieving Connections
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you have set ``connections_path`` as ``connections`` and ``mount_point`` as ``airflow``, then for a connection id of
``smtp_default``, you would want to store your secret as:

.. code-block:: bash

    vault kv put airflow/connections/smtp_default conn_uri=smtps://user:host@relay.example.com:465

Note that the ``Key`` is ``conn_uri``, ``Value`` is ``postgresql://airflow:airflow@host:5432/airflow`` and
``mount_point`` is ``airflow``.

You can make a ``mount_point`` for ``airflow`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    vault secrets enable -path=airflow -version=2 kv

Verify that you can get the secret from ``vault``:

.. code-block:: console

    ❯ vault kv get airflow/connections/smtp_default
    ====== Metadata ======
    Key              Value
    ---              -----
    created_time     2020-03-19T19:17:51.281721Z
    deletion_time    n/a
    destroyed        false
    version          1

    ====== Data ======
    Key         Value
    ---         -----
    conn_uri    smtps://user:host@relay.example.com:465

The value of the Vault key must be the :ref:`connection URI representation <generating_connection_uri>`
of the connection object to get connection.

Storing and Retrieving Variables
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you have set ``variables_path`` as ``variables`` and ``mount_point`` as ``airflow``, then for a variable with
``hello`` as key, you would want to store your secret as:

.. code-block:: bash

    vault kv put airflow/variables/hello value=world

Verify that you can get the secret from ``vault``:

.. code-block:: console

    ❯ vault kv get airflow/variables/hello
    ====== Metadata ======
    Key              Value
    ---              -----
    created_time     2020-03-28T02:10:54.301784Z
    deletion_time    n/a
    destroyed        false
    version          1

    ==== Data ====
    Key      Value
    ---      -----
    value    world

Note that the secret ``Key`` is ``value``, and secret ``Value`` is ``world`` and
``mount_point`` is ``airflow``.
