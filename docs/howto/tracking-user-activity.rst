Tracking User Activity
=============================

You can configure Airflow to route anonymous data to
`Google Analytics <https://analytics.google.com/>`_,
`Segment <https://segment.com/>`_, or `Metarouter <https://www.metarouter.io/>`_.

Edit ``airflow.cfg`` and set the ``webserver`` block to have an ``analytics_tool`` and ``analytics_id``:

.. code-block:: python

  [webserver]
  # Send anonymous user activity to Google Analytics, Segment, or Metarouter
  analytics_tool = google_analytics # valid options: google_analytics, segment, metarouter
  analytics_id = XXXXXXXXXXX

.. note:: You can see view injected tracker html within Airflow's source code at
  ``airflow/www/templates/appbuilder/baselayout.html``. The related global
  variables are set in ``airflow/www/templates/app.py``.

.. note::
    For more information on setting the configuration, see :doc:`../howto/set-config`
