Running Airflow behind a reverse proxy
======================================

Airflow can be set up behind a reverse proxy, with the ability to set its endpoint with great
flexibility.

For example, you can configure your reverse proxy to get:

::

    https://lab.mycompany.com/myorg/airflow/

To do so, you need to set the following setting in your ``airflow.cfg``::

    base_url = http://my_host/myorg/airflow

Additionally if you use Celery Executor, you can get Flower in ``/myorg/flower`` with::

    flower_url_prefix = /myorg/flower

Your reverse proxy (ex: nginx) should be configured as follow:

- pass the url and http header as it for the Airflow webserver, without any rewrite, for example::

      server {
        listen 80;
        server_name lab.mycompany.com;

        location /myorg/airflow/ {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        }
      }

- rewrite the url for the flower endpoint::

      server {
          listen 80;
          server_name lab.mycompany.com;

          location /myorg/flower/ {
              rewrite ^/myorg/flower/(.*)$ /$1 break;  # remove prefix from http header
              proxy_pass http://localhost:5555;
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
              proxy_redirect off;
              proxy_http_version 1.1;
              proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
              proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          }
      }

To ensure that Airflow generates URLs with the correct scheme when
running behind a TLS-terminating proxy, you should configure the proxy
to set the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header, and enable the ``ProxyFix``
middleware in your ``airflow.cfg``::

    [webserver]
    enable_proxy_fix = True

If you need to configure the individual parameters to the ``ProxyFix`` middleware,
you can set them individually in your ``airflow.cfg``::
  
    [webserver]
    proxy_fix_x_for = 1
    proxy_fix_x_host = 3

.. note::
    You should only enable the ``ProxyFix`` middleware when running
    Airflow behind a trusted proxy (AWS ELB, nginx, etc.).
