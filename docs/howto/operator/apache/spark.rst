Apache Spark Operators
======================

.. contents::

Prerequisite
------------

To use ``SparkJDBCOperator`` and ``SparkSubmitOperator``, you must configure a :doc:`Spark Connection <apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark:connections/spark>`. For ``SparkJDBCOperator``, you must also configure a :doc:`JDBC connection <apache-airflow-providers-jdbc:connections/jdbc>`.

``SparkSqlOperator`` gets all the configurations from operator parameters.

.. _howto/operator:SparkJDBCOperator:

SparkJDBCOperator
-----------------

Launches applications on a Apache Spark server, it uses ``SparkSubmitOperator`` to perform data transfers to/from JDBC-based databases.

For parameter definition take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.spark.operators.spark_jdbc.SparkJDBCOperator`.

Using the operator
""""""""""""""""""

Using ``cmd_type`` parameter, is possible to transfer data from Spark to a database (``spark_to_jdbc``) or from a database to Spark (``jdbc_to_spark``), which will write the table using the Spark command ``saveAsTable``.

For further information, look at `Apache Spark DataFrameWriter documentation <https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameWriter>`_.

.. _howto/operator:SparkSqlOperator:

SparkSqlOperator
----------------

Launches applications on a Apache Spark server, it requires that the ``spark-sql`` script is in the PATH.
The operator will run the SQL query on Spark Hive metastore service, the ``sql`` parameter can be templated and be a ``.sql`` or ``.hql`` file.

For parameter definition take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.spark.operators.spark_sql.SparkSqlOperator`.

.. _howto/operator:SparkSubmitOperator:

SparkSubmitOperator
-------------------

Launches applications on a Apache Spark server, it uses the ``spark-submit`` script that takes care of setting up the classpath with Spark and its dependencies, and can support different cluster managers and deploy modes that Spark supports.

For parameter definition take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.spark.operators.spark_submit.SparkSubmitOperator`.
