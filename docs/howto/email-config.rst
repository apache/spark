Email Configuration
===================

You can configure the email that is being sent in your ``airflow.cfg``
by setting a ``subject_template`` and/or a ``html_content_template``
in the ``email`` section.

.. code-block::

  [email]

  email_backend = airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp

  subject_template = /path/to/my_subject_template_file
  html_content_template = /path/to/my_html_content_template_file

To access the task's information you use `Jinja Templating <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_  in your template files.

For example a ``html_content_template`` file could look like this:

.. code-block::

  Try {{try_number}} out of {{max_tries + 1}}<br>
  Exception:<br>{{exception_html}}<br>
  Log: <a href="{{ti.log_url}}">Link</a><br>
  Host: {{ti.hostname}}<br>
  Log file: {{ti.log_filepath}}<br>
  Mark success: <a href="{{ti.mark_success_url}}">Link</a><br>

.. note::
    For more information on setting the configuration, see :doc:`set-config`

Send email using SendGrid
-------------------------

Airflow can be configured to send e-mail using `SendGrid <https://sendgrid.com/>`__.

Follow the steps below to enable it:

1. Include ``sendgrid`` subpackage as part of your Airflow installation, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: ini

     pip install 'apache-airflow[sendgrid]'

2. Update ``email_backend`` property in ``[email]`` section in ``airflow.cfg``, i.e.

   .. code-block:: ini

      [email]
      email_backend = airflow.providers.sendgrid.utils.emailer.send_email

3. Configure SendGrid specific environment variables at all Airflow instances:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM={your-mail-from}
      export SENDGRID_API_KEY={your-sendgrid-api-key}
