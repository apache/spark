[SQLSTATE: 42P21](sql-error-conditions-sqlstates.html#class-42-syntax-error-or-access-rule-violation)

Could not determine which collation to use for string functions and operators.

This error class has the following derived error classes:

## EXPLICIT

Error occurred due to the mismatch between explicit collations: `<explicitTypes>`. Decide on a single explicit collation and remove others.

## IMPLICIT

Error occurred due to the mismatch between implicit collations: `<implicitTypes>`. Use COLLATE function to set the collation explicitly.
