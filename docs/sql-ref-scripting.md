You can employ powerful procedural logic using SQL/PSM standard-based scripting syntax.
Any SQL script consists of and starts with a [compound statement](control-flow/compound-stmt.html) block (`BEGIN ... END`).
A compound statement starts with a section to declare local variables, user-defined conditions, and condition handlers, which are used to catch exceptions.
This is followed by the compound statement body, which consists of:

- Flow control statements include loops over predicate expressions, [FOR](control-flow/for-stmt.html) loops over query results, conditional logic such as [IF](control-flow/if-stmt.html) and [CASE](control-flow/case-stmt.html), and means to break out loops such as [LEAVE](control-flow/leave-stmt.html) and [ITERATE](control-flow/iterate-stmt.html).
- DDL statements such as `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `DROP`.
- DML statements [INSERT](sql-ref-syntax-dml-insert-into.html).
- [Queries](sql-ref-syntax-qry-select.html) that return result sets to the invoker of the script.
- [SET](sql-ref-syntax-aux-set-var.html) statements to set local variables as well as session variables.
- The [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE](sql-ref-syntax-aux-exec-imm.html) statement.
- Nested compound statements, which provide nested scopes for variables, conditions, and condition handlers.

## Passing data between the invoker and the compound statement

There are two ways to pass data to and from a SQL script:

- Use session variables to pass scalar values or small sets of arrays or maps from one SQL script to another.
- Use parameter markers to pass scalar values or small sets of arrays or map data from a notebook widget, Python, or another language to the SQL Script.

## Variable scoping

Variables declared within a compound statement can be referenced in any expression within a compound statement.
Spark resolves identifiers from the innermost scope outward, following the rules described in [Name Resolution](sql-ref-name-resolution.html).
You can use the optional compound statement labels to disambiguate duplicate variable names.

## Condition handling

SQL Scripting supports condition handlers, which are used to intercept and process exceptions to `EXIT` processing of the SQL script.
Within the condition handler, you can [RESIGNAL](control-flow/resignal-stmt.html) the original exception, [SIGNAL](control-flow/signal-stmt.html) a new exception, or exit the compound statement without an exception.

Condition handlers can be defined to handle three distinct classes of conditions:

- One or more named conditions that can be a specific Spark-defined error class such as `DIVIDE_BY_ZERO` or a user-declared condition.
  These handlers handle these specific conditions.

- One or more `SQLSTATE`s, that can be raised by Spark or a user `SIGNAL` statement.
  These handlers can handle any condition associated with that `SQLSTATE`.

- A generic `SQLEXCEPTION` handler can catch all conditions falling into the `SQLEXCEPTION` (any `SQLSTATE` which is not `XX***` and not `02***`).

The following are used to decide which condition handler applies to an exception.
This condition handler is called the **most appropriate handler**:

- A condition handler cannot apply to any statement defined in its own body or the body of any condition handler declared in the same compound statement.

- The applicable condition handlers defined in the innermost compound statement within which the exception was raised are appropriate.

- If more than one appropriate handler is available, the most specific handler is the most appropriate.
  For example, a handler on a named condition is more specific than one on a named `SQLSTATE`.
  A generic `EXCEPTION` handler is the least specific.

Unless a handler `SIGNAL`s or `RESIGNAL`s a condition of its own, the outcome of a condition handler is to execute the statement following the compound statement that declared the handler to execute next.

The following is a list of supported control flow statements:

* [CASE](control-flow/case-stmt.html)
* [compound statement](control-flow/compound-stmt.html)
* [FOR](control-flow/for-stmt.html)
* [GET DIAGNOSTICS](control-flow/get-diagnostics-stmt.html)
* [IF](control-flow/if-stmt.html)
* [ITERATE](control-flow/iterate-stmt.html)
* [LEAVE](control-flow/leave-stmt.html)
* [LOOP](control-flow/loop-stmt.html)
* [REPEAT](control-flow/repeat-stmt.html)
* [RESIGNAL](control-flow/resignal-stmt.html)
* [SIGNAL](control-flow/signal-stmt.html)
* [WHILE](control-flow/while-stmt.html)
