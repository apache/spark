Installation from PyPI
----------------------

.. contents:: :local:


This page describes installations using the ``apache-airflow-providers`` package `published in
PyPI <https://pypi.org/search/?q=apache-airflow-providers>`__.

Installation tools
''''''''''''''''''

Only ``pip`` installation is currently officially supported.

While there are some successes with using other tools like `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ or
`pip-tools <https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/>`_, they do not share the same workflow as
``pip`` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.
Installing via ``Poetry`` or ``pip-tools`` is not currently supported. If you wish to install airflow
using those tools you should use the constraints and convert them to appropriate
format and workflow that your tool requires.

Typical command to install airflow from PyPI looks like below (you need to use the right Airflow version and Python version):

.. code-block::

    pip install "apache-airflow-providers-celery" --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.1.4/constraints-3.6.txt"

This is an example, see :doc:`apache-airflow:installation/installing-from-pypi` for more examples, including how to upgrade the providers.
