### Description

Views are based on the result-set of an `SQL` query. `CREATE VIEW` constructs
a virtual table that has no physical data therefore other operations like
`ALTER VIEW` and `DROP VIEW` only change metadata. 

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ [ GLOBAL ] TEMPORARY ] VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] view_identifier
    create_view_clauses AS query
```

### Parameters

* **OR REPLACE**

    If a view of same name already exists, it will be replaced.

* **[ GLOBAL ] TEMPORARY**

    TEMPORARY views are session-scoped and will be dropped when session ends
    because it skips persisting the definition in the underlying metastore, if any.
    GLOBAL TEMPORARY views are tied to a system preserved temporary database `global_temp`.

* **IF NOT EXISTS**

    Creates a view if it does not exist.

* **view_identifier**

    Specifies a view name, which may be optionally qualified with a database name.

    **Syntax:** `[ database_name. ] view_name`

* **create_view_clauses**

    These clauses are optional and order insensitive. It can be of following formats.

    * `[ ( column_name [ COMMENT column_comment ], ... ) ]` to specify column-level comments.
    * `[ COMMENT view_comment ]` to specify view-level comments.
    * `[ TBLPROPERTIES ( property_name = property_value [ , ... ] ) ]` to add metadata key-value pairs.
    * `[ WITH SCHEMA { BINDING | COMPENSATION | [ TYPE ] EVOLUTION } ]` to specify how the view reacts to schema changes

      This clause is not supported for `TEMPORARY` views.

      * **BINDING** - The view can tolerate only type changes in the underlying schema requiring safe up-casts.
      * **COMPENSATION** - The view can tolerate type changes in the underlying schema requiring casts. Runtime casting errors may occur.
      * **TYPE EVOLUTION** - The view will adapt to any type changes in the underlying schema.
      * **EVOLUTION** - For views defined without a column lists any schema changes are adapted by the view, including, for queries with `SELECT *` dropped or added columns.
        If the view is defined with a column list, the clause is interpreted as `TYPE EVOLUTION`.
      
      The default is `WITH SCHEMA COMPENSATION`.

* **query**
  A [SELECT](sql-ref-syntax-qry-select.html) statement that constructs the view from base tables or other views.

### Examples

```sql
-- Create or replace view for `experienced_employee` with comments.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW experienced_employee
    (ID COMMENT 'Unique identification number', Name) 
    COMMENT 'View for experienced employees'
    AS SELECT id, name FROM all_employee
        WHERE working_years > 5;

-- Create a global temporary view `subscribed_movies` if it does not exist.
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW IF NOT EXISTS subscribed_movies 
    AS SELECT mo.member_id, mb.full_name, mo.movie_title
        FROM movies AS mo INNER JOIN members AS mb 
        ON mo.member_id = mb.id;

-- Create a view filtering the `orders` table which will adjust to schema changes in `orders`.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW open_orders WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION
    AS SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'open';
```
