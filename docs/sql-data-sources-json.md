Spark SQL can automatically infer the schema of a JSON dataset and load it as a `Dataset[Row]`.
This conversion can be done using `SparkSession.read.json()` on either a `Dataset[String]`,
or a JSON file.

Note that the file that is offered as _a json file_ is not a typical JSON file. Each
line must contain a separate, self-contained valid JSON object. For more information, please see
[JSON Lines text format, also called newline-delimited JSON](http://jsonlines.org/).

For a regular multi-line JSON file, set the `multiLine` option to `true`.

Spark SQL can automatically infer the schema of a JSON dataset and load it as a DataFrame. using
the `read.json()` function, which loads data from a directory of JSON files where each line of the
files is a JSON object.

line must contain a separate, self-contained valid JSON object. For more information, please see

For a regular multi-line JSON file, set a named parameter `multiLine` to `TRUE`.
