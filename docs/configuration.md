Spark provides three locations to configure the system:

* [Spark properties](#spark-properties) control most application parameters and can be set by using
  a [SparkConf](api/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkConf.html) object, or through Java
  system properties.
* [Environment variables](#environment-variables) can be used to set per-machine settings, such as
  the IP address, through the `conf/spark-env.sh` script on each node.
* [Logging](#configuring-logging) can be configured through `log4j2.properties`.

# Spark Properties

Spark properties control most application settings and are configured separately for each
application. These properties can be set directly on a
[SparkConf](api/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkConf.html) passed to your
`SparkContext`. `SparkConf` allows you to configure some of the common properties
(e.g. master URL and application name), as well as arbitrary key-value pairs through the
`set()` method. For example, we could initialize an application with two threads as follows:

Note that we run with local[2], meaning two threads - which represents "minimal" parallelism,
which can help detect bugs that only exist when we run in a distributed context.

{% highlight scala %}
val conf = new SparkConf()
             .setMaster("local[2]")
             .setAppName("CountingSheep")
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we can have more than 1 thread in local mode, and in cases like Spark Streaming, we may
actually require more than 1 thread to prevent any sort of starvation issues.

Properties that specify some time duration should be configured with a unit of time.
The following format is accepted:

    25ms (milliseconds)
    5s (seconds)
    10m or 10min (minutes)
    3h (hours)
    5d (days)
    1y (years)


Properties that specify a byte size should be configured with a unit of size.
The following format is accepted:

    1b (bytes)
    1k or 1kb (kibibytes = 1024 bytes)
    1m or 1mb (mebibytes = 1024 kibibytes)
    1g or 1gb (gibibytes = 1024 mebibytes)
    1t or 1tb (tebibytes = 1024 gibibytes)
    1p or 1pb (pebibytes = 1024 tebibytes)

While numbers without units are generally interpreted as bytes, a few are interpreted as KiB or MiB.
See documentation of individual configuration properties. Specifying units is desirable where
possible.

## Dynamically Loading Spark Properties

In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a `SparkConf`. For
instance, if you'd like to run the same application with different masters or different
amounts of memory. Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf:

{% highlight scala %}
val sc = new SparkContext(new SparkConf())
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can supply configuration values at runtime:
```sh
./bin/spark-submit \
  --name "My app" \
  --master "local[4]" \
  --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=false \
  --conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps" \
  myApp.jar
```

The Spark shell and [`spark-submit`](submitting-applications.html)
tool support two ways to load configurations dynamically. The first is command line options,
such as `--master`, as shown above. `spark-submit` can accept any Spark property using the `--conf/-c`
flag, but uses special flags for properties that play a part in launching the Spark application.
Running `./bin/spark-submit --help` will show the entire list of these options.

When configurations are specified via the `--conf/-c` flags, `bin/spark-submit` will also read
configuration options from `conf/spark-defaults.conf`, in which each line consists of a key and
a value separated by whitespace. For example:

    spark.master            spark://5.6.7.8:7077
    spark.executor.memory   4g
    spark.eventLog.enabled  true
    spark.serializer        org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer

In addition, a property file with Spark configurations can be passed to `bin/spark-submit` via
`--properties-file` parameter. When this is set, Spark will no longer load configurations from
`conf/spark-defaults.conf` unless another parameter `--load-spark-defaults` is provided.

Any values specified as flags or in the properties file will be passed on to the application
and merged with those specified through SparkConf. Properties set directly on the SparkConf
take the highest precedence, then those through `--conf` flags or `--properties-file` passed to
`spark-submit` or `spark-shell`, then options in the `spark-defaults.conf` file. A few
configuration keys have been renamed since earlier versions of Spark; in such cases, the older
key names are still accepted, but take lower precedence than any instance of the newer key.

Spark properties mainly can be divided into two kinds: one is related to deploy, like
"spark.driver.memory", "spark.executor.instances", this kind of properties may not be affected when
setting programmatically through `SparkConf` in runtime, or the behavior is depending on which
cluster manager and deploy mode you choose, so it would be suggested to set through configuration
file or `spark-submit` command line options; another is mainly related to Spark runtime control,
like "spark.task.maxFailures", this kind of properties can be set in either way.

## Viewing Spark Properties

The application web UI at `http://<driver>:4040` lists Spark properties in the "Environment" tab.
This is a useful place to check to make sure that your properties have been set correctly. Note
that only values explicitly specified through `spark-defaults.conf`, `SparkConf`, or the command
line will appear. For all other configuration properties, you can assume the default value is used.

## Available Properties

Most of the properties that control internal settings have reasonable default values. Some
of the most common options to set are:

### Application Properties

<table class="spark-config">
<thead><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Since Version</th></tr></thead>

    Limit of total size of serialized results of all partitions for each Spark action (e.g.
    collect) in bytes. Should be at least 1M, or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total
    size is above this limit.
    Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory
    and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from
    out-of-memory errors.

    <br />
    <em>Note:</em> In client mode, this config must not be set through the <code>SparkConf</code>

    This option is currently supported on YARN and Kubernetes.
    <em>Note:</em> Non-heap memory includes off-heap memory
    (when <code>spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true</code>) and memory used by other driver processes
    (e.g. python process that goes with a PySpark driver) and memory used by other non-driver
    processes running in the same container. The maximum memory size of container to running

    This value defaults to 0.10 except for Kubernetes non-JVM jobs, which defaults to
    0.40. This is done as non-JVM tasks need more non-JVM heap space and such tasks
    commonly fail with "Memory Overhead Exceeded" errors. This preempts this error
    with a higher default.

    and it is up to the application to avoid exceeding the overhead memory space
    shared with other non-JVM processes. When PySpark is run in YARN or Kubernetes, this memory
    is added to executor resource requests.
    <br/>

    If the Spark UI should be served through another front-end reverse proxy, this is the URL
    for accessing the Spark master UI through that reverse proxy.
    This is useful when running proxy for authentication e.g. an OAuth proxy. The URL may contain
    a path prefix, like <code>http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark/</code>, allowing you to serve the
    UI for multiple Spark clusters and other web applications through the same virtual host and
    port.
    Normally, this should be an absolute URL including scheme (http/https), host and port.
    It is possible to specify a relative URL starting with "/" here. In this case, all URLs
    generated by the Spark UI and Spark REST APIs will be server-relative links -- this will still
    work, as the entire Spark UI is served through the same host and port.
    <br/>The setting affects link generation in the Spark UI, but the front-end reverse proxy
    is responsible for
    <ul>
      <li>stripping a path prefix before forwarding the request,</li>
      <li>rewriting redirects which point directly to the Spark master,</li>
      <li>redirecting access from <code>http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark</code> to
      <code>http://mydomain.com/path/to/spark/</code> (trailing slash after path prefix); otherwise

    master web UI is directly reachable.<br/>

### Thread Configurations

Depending on jobs and cluster configurations, we can set number of threads in several places in Spark to utilize
available resources efficiently to get better performance. Prior to Spark 3.0, these thread configurations apply
to all roles of Spark, such as driver, executor, worker and master. From Spark 3.0, we can configure threads in
finer granularity starting from driver and executor. Take RPC module as example in below table. For other modules,
like shuffle, just replace "rpc" with "shuffle" in the property names except
<code>spark.{driver|executor}.rpc.netty.dispatcher.numThreads</code>, which is only for RPC module.

<table class="spark-config">
<thead><tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Default</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Since Version</th></tr></thead>
<tr>
  <td><code>spark.{driver|executor}.rpc.io.serverThreads</code></td>
  <td>
    Fall back on <code>spark.rpc.io.serverThreads</code>

  <td>1.6.0</td>

<tr>
  <td><code>spark.{driver|executor}.rpc.io.clientThreads</code></td>

  <td>
    Fall back on <code>spark.rpc.netty.dispatcher.numThreads</code>
  </td>
  <td>Number of threads used in RPC message dispatcher thread pool</td>
  <td>3.0.0</td>
</tr>
</table>

The default value for number of thread-related config keys is the minimum of the number of cores requested for
the driver or executor, or, in the absence of that value, the number of cores available for the JVM (with a hardcoded upper limit of 8).

### Security

Please refer to the [Security](security.html) page for available options on how to secure different
Spark subsystems.


### Spark SQL

#### Runtime SQL Configuration

Runtime SQL configurations are per-session, mutable Spark SQL configurations. They can be set with initial values by the config file
and command-line options with `--conf/-c` prefixed, or by setting `SparkConf` that are used to create `SparkSession`.
Also, they can be set and queried by SET commands and reset to their initial values by RESET command,
or by `SparkSession.conf`'s setter and getter methods in runtime.

{% include_api_gen generated-runtime-sql-config-table.html %}

#### Static SQL Configuration

Static SQL configurations are cross-session, immutable Spark SQL configurations. They can be set with final values by the config file
and command-line options with `--conf/-c` prefixed, or by setting `SparkConf` that are used to create `SparkSession`.
External users can query the static sql config values via `SparkSession.conf` or via set command, e.g. `SET spark.sql.extensions;`, but cannot set/unset them.

### Cluster Managers

Each cluster manager in Spark has additional configuration options. Configurations
can be found on the pages for each mode:

#### [YARN](running-on-yarn.html#configuration)

#### [Kubernetes](running-on-kubernetes.html#configuration)

#### [Standalone Mode](spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts)

# Environment Variables

Certain Spark settings can be configured through environment variables, which are read from the
`conf/spark-env.sh` script in the directory where Spark is installed (or `conf/spark-env.cmd` on
Windows). In Standalone mode, this file can give machine specific information such as
hostnames. It is also sourced when running local Spark applications or submission scripts.

Note that `conf/spark-env.sh` does not exist by default when Spark is installed. However, you can
copy `conf/spark-env.sh.template` to create it. Make sure you make the copy executable.

The following variables can be set in `spark-env.sh`:


<table>
  <thead><tr><th style="width:21%">Environment Variable</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
  <tr>
    <td><code>JAVA_HOME</code></td>
    <td>Location where Java is installed (if it's not on your default <code>PATH</code>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code></td>
    <td>Python binary executable to use for PySpark in both driver and workers (default is <code>python3</code> if available, otherwise <code>python</code>).
    Property <code>spark.pyspark.python</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON</code></td>
    <td>Python binary executable to use for PySpark in driver only (default is <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code>).
    Property <code>spark.pyspark.driver.python</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARKR_DRIVER_R</code></td>
    <td>R binary executable to use for SparkR shell (default is <code>R</code>).
    Property <code>spark.r.shell.command</code> take precedence if it is set</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_LOCAL_IP</code></td>
    <td>IP address of the machine to bind to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS</code></td>
    <td>Hostname your Spark program will advertise to other machines.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In addition to the above, there are also options for setting up the Spark
[standalone cluster scripts](spark-standalone.html#cluster-launch-scripts), such as number of cores
to use on each machine and maximum memory.

Since `spark-env.sh` is a shell script, some of these can be set programmatically -- for example, you might
compute `SPARK_LOCAL_IP` by looking up the IP of a specific network interface.

Note: When running Spark on YARN in `cluster` mode, environment variables need to be set using the `spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.[EnvironmentVariableName]` property in your `conf/spark-defaults.conf` file.  Environment variables that are set in `spark-env.sh` will not be reflected in the YARN Application Master process in `cluster` mode.  See the [YARN-related Spark Properties](running-on-yarn.html#spark-properties) for more information.

# Configuring Logging

Spark uses [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) for logging. You can configure it by adding a
`log4j2.properties` file in the `conf` directory. One way to start is to copy the existing templates `log4j2.properties.template` or `log4j2.properties.pattern-layout-template` located there.

## Structured Logging
Starting from version 4.0.0, `spark-submit` has adopted the [JSON Template Layout](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/json-template-layout.html) for logging, which outputs logs in JSON format. This format facilitates querying logs using Spark SQL with the JSON data source. Additionally, the logs include all Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) information for search and debugging purposes.

To configure the layout of structured logging, start with the `log4j2.properties.template` file.

To query Spark logs using Spark SQL, you can use the following code snippets:

**Python:**
```python
from pyspark.logger import SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA

logDf = spark.read.schema(SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA).json("path/to/logs")
```

**Scala:**
```scala
import org.apache.spark.util.LogUtils.SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA

val logDf = spark.read.schema(SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA).json("path/to/logs")
```
**Note**: If you're using the interactive shell (pyspark shell or spark-shell), you can omit the import statement in the code because SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA is already available in the shell's context.
## Plain Text Logging
If you prefer plain text logging, you have two options:
- Disable structured JSON logging by setting the Spark configuration `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` to `false`.
- Use a custom log4j configuration file. Rename `conf/log4j2.properties.pattern-layout-template` to `conf/log4j2.properties`. This reverts to the default configuration prior to Spark 4.0, which utilizes [PatternLayout](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout) for logging all messages in plain text.

MDC information is not included by default when with plain text logging. In order to print it in the logs, you can update the patternLayout in the file. For example, you can add `%X{task_name}` to print the task name in the logs.
Moreover, you can use `spark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(s"mdc.$name", "value")` to add user specific data into MDC.
The key in MDC will be the string of `mdc.$name`.

# Overriding configuration directory

To specify a different configuration directory other than the default "SPARK_HOME/conf",
you can set SPARK_CONF_DIR. Spark will use the configuration files (spark-defaults.conf, spark-env.sh, log4j2.properties, etc)
from this directory.

# Inheriting Hadoop Cluster Configuration

If you plan to read and write from HDFS using Spark, there are two Hadoop configuration files that
should be included on Spark's classpath:

* `hdfs-site.xml`, which provides default behaviors for the HDFS client.
* `core-site.xml`, which sets the default filesystem name.

The location of these configuration files varies across Hadoop versions, but
a common location is inside of `/etc/hadoop/conf`. Some tools create
configurations on-the-fly, but offer a mechanism to download copies of them.

To make these files visible to Spark, set `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-env.sh`
to a location containing the configuration files.

# Custom Hadoop/Hive Configuration

If your Spark application is interacting with Hadoop, Hive, or both, there are probably Hadoop/Hive
configuration files in Spark's classpath.

Multiple running applications might require different Hadoop/Hive client side configurations.
You can copy and modify `hdfs-site.xml`, `core-site.xml`, `yarn-site.xml`, `hive-site.xml` in
Spark's classpath for each application. In a Spark cluster running on YARN, these configuration
files are set cluster-wide, and cannot safely be changed by the application.

The better choice is to use spark hadoop properties in the form of `spark.hadoop.*`, and use
spark hive properties in the form of `spark.hive.*`.
For example, adding configuration "spark.hadoop.abc.def=xyz" represents adding hadoop property "abc.def=xyz",
and adding configuration "spark.hive.abc=xyz" represents adding hive property "hive.abc=xyz".
They can be considered as same as normal spark properties which can be set in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`

In some cases, you may want to avoid hard-coding certain configurations in a `SparkConf`. For
instance, Spark allows you to simply create an empty conf and set spark/spark hadoop/spark hive properties.

{% highlight scala %}
val conf = new SparkConf().set("spark.hadoop.abc.def", "xyz")
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
{% endhighlight %}

Also, you can modify or add configurations at runtime:
{% highlight bash %}
./bin/spark-submit \
  --name "My app" \
  --master "local[4]" \
  --conf spark.eventLog.enabled=false \
  --conf "spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps" \
  --conf spark.hadoop.abc.def=xyz \
  --conf spark.hive.abc=xyz
  myApp.jar
{% endhighlight %}

# Custom Resource Scheduling and Configuration Overview

GPUs and other accelerators have been widely used for accelerating special workloads, e.g.,
deep learning and signal processing. Spark now supports requesting and scheduling generic resources, such as GPUs, with a few caveats. The current implementation requires that the resource have addresses that can be allocated by the scheduler. It requires your cluster manager to support and be properly configured with the resources.

There are configurations available to request resources for the driver: `spark.driver.resource.{resourceName}.amount`, request resources for the executor(s): `spark.executor.resource.{resourceName}.amount` and specify the requirements for each task: `spark.task.resource.{resourceName}.amount`. The `spark.driver.resource.{resourceName}.discoveryScript` config is required on YARN, Kubernetes and a client side Driver on Spark Standalone. `spark.executor.resource.{resourceName}.discoveryScript` config is required for YARN and Kubernetes. Kubernetes also requires `spark.driver.resource.{resourceName}.vendor` and/or `spark.executor.resource.{resourceName}.vendor`. See the config descriptions above for more information on each.

Spark will use the configurations specified to first request containers with the corresponding resources from the cluster manager. Once it gets the container, Spark launches an Executor in that container which will discover what resources the container has and the addresses associated with each resource. The Executor will register with the Driver and report back the resources available to that Executor. The Spark scheduler can then schedule tasks to each Executor and assign specific resource addresses based on the resource requirements the user specified. The user can see the resources assigned to a task using the `TaskContext.get().resources` api. On the driver, the user can see the resources assigned with the SparkContext `resources` call. It's then up to the user to use the assigned addresses to do the processing they want or pass those into the ML/AI framework they are using.

See your cluster manager specific page for requirements and details on each of - [YARN](running-on-yarn.html#resource-allocation-and-configuration-overview), [Kubernetes](running-on-kubernetes.html#resource-allocation-and-configuration-overview) and [Standalone Mode](spark-standalone.html#resource-allocation-and-configuration-overview). It is currently not available with local mode. And please also note that local-cluster mode with multiple workers is not supported(see Standalone documentation).

# Stage Level Scheduling Overview

The stage level scheduling feature allows users to specify task and executor resource requirements at the stage level. This allows for different stages to run with executors that have different resources. A prime example of this is one ETL stage runs with executors with just CPUs, the next stage is an ML stage that needs GPUs. Stage level scheduling allows for user to request different executors that have GPUs when the ML stage runs rather then having to acquire executors with GPUs at the start of the application and them be idle while the ETL stage is being run.
This is only available for the RDD API in Scala, Java, and Python.  It is available on YARN, Kubernetes and Standalone when dynamic allocation is enabled. When dynamic allocation is disabled, it allows users to specify different task resource requirements at stage level, and this is supported on YARN, Kubernetes and Standalone cluster right now. See the [YARN](running-on-yarn.html#stage-level-scheduling-overview) page or [Kubernetes](running-on-kubernetes.html#stage-level-scheduling-overview) page or [Standalone](spark-standalone.html#stage-level-scheduling-overview) page for more implementation details.

See the `RDD.withResources` and `ResourceProfileBuilder` API's for using this feature. When dynamic allocation is disabled, tasks with different task resource requirements will share executors with `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PROFILE`. While when dynamic allocation is enabled, the current implementation acquires new executors for each `ResourceProfile`  created and currently has to be an exact match. Spark does not try to fit tasks into an executor that require a different ResourceProfile than the executor was created with. Executors that are not in use will idle timeout with the dynamic allocation logic. The default configuration for this feature is to only allow one ResourceProfile per stage. If the user associates more then 1 ResourceProfile to an RDD, Spark will throw an exception by default. See config `spark.scheduler.resource.profileMergeConflicts` to control that behavior. The current merge strategy Spark implements when `spark.scheduler.resource.profileMergeConflicts` is enabled is a simple max of each resource within the conflicting ResourceProfiles. Spark will create a new ResourceProfile with the max of each of the resources.

# Push-based shuffle overview

Push-based shuffle helps improve the reliability and performance of spark shuffle. It takes a best-effort approach to push the shuffle blocks generated by the map tasks to remote external shuffle services to be merged per shuffle partition. Reduce tasks fetch a combination of merged shuffle partitions and original shuffle blocks as their input data, resulting in converting small random disk reads by external shuffle services into large sequential reads. Possibility of better data locality for reduce tasks additionally helps minimize network IO. Push-based shuffle takes priority over batch fetch for some scenarios, like partition coalesce when merged output is available.

<p> Push-based shuffle improves performance for long running jobs/queries which involves large disk I/O during shuffle. Currently it is not well suited for jobs/queries which runs quickly dealing with lesser amount of shuffle data. This will be further improved in the future releases.</p>

<p> <b> Currently push-based shuffle is only supported for Spark on YARN with external shuffle service. </b></p>

    Number of threads used by driver to finalize shuffle merge. Since it could potentially take seconds for a large shuffle to finalize,
    having multiple threads helps driver to handle concurrent shuffle merge finalize requests when push-based shuffle is enabled.

  <td><code>spark.shuffle.push.minShuffleSizeToWait</code></td>
  <td><code>500m</code></td>
  <td>
    Driver will wait for merge finalization to complete only if total shuffle data size is more than this threshold. If total shuffle size is less, driver will immediately finalize the shuffle output.
