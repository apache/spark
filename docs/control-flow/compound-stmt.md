Implements a SQL Script block that can contain a sequence of SQL statements, control-of-flow statements, local variable declarations, and exception handlers.

## Syntax

```
[ label : ]
      BEGIN
      [ { declare_variable | declare_condition } ; [...] ]
      [ declare_handler ; [...] ]
      [ SQL_statement ; [...] ]
      END [ label ]

declare_variable
  DECLARE variable_name datatype [ DEFAULT default_expr ]

declare_condition
  DECLARE condition_name CONDITION [ FOR SQLSTATE [ VALUE ] sqlstate ]

declare_handler
  DECLARE handler_type HANDLER FOR condition_values handler_action

handler_type
  EXIT

condition_values
 { { SQLSTATE [ VALUE ] sqlstate | condition_name } [, ...] |
   { SQLEXCEPTION | NOT FOUND } [, ...] }
```

## Parameters

- **`label`**

  An optional identifier is used to qualify variables defined within the compound and to leave the compound.
  Both label occurrences must match, and the `END` label can only be specified if `label:` is specified.

  `label` must not be specified for a top level compound statement.

- **`NOT ATOMIC`**

  Specifies that, if an SQL statement within the compound fails, previous SQL statements will not be rolled back.
  This is the default and only behavior.

- **`declare_variable`**

  A local variable declaration for one or more variables

  - **`variable_name`**

    A name for the variable.
    The name must not be qualified, and be unique within the compound statement.

  - **`data_type`**

    Any supported data type. If data_type is omitted, you must specify DEFAULT, and the type is derived from the default_expression.

  - **`{ DEFAULT | = } default_expression`**

    Defines the variable's initial value after declaration. default_expression must be castable to data_type. If no default is specified, the variable is initialized with NULL.

- **`Declare_condition`**

  A local condition declaration

  - **`condition_name`**

    The unqualified name of the condition is scoped to the compound statement.

  - **`sqlstate`**

    A `STRING` literal of 5 alphanumeric characters (case insensitive) consisting of A-Z and 0..9. The SQLSTATE must not start with ‘00’, ‘01’, or ‘XX’. Any SQLSTATE starting with ‘02’ will be caught by the predefined NOT FOUND exception as well. If not specified, the SQLSTATE is ‘45000’.

- **`declare_handler`**

  A declaration for an error handler.

  - **`handler_type`**

    - **`EXIT`**

      Classifies the handler to exit the compound statement after the condition is handled.

  - **`condition_values`**

    Specifies to which sqlstates or conditions the handler applies.
    Condition values must be unique within all handlers within the compound statement.
    Specific condition values take precedence over `SQLEXCEPTION`.

  - **`sqlstate`**

    A `STRING` literal of 5 characters `'A'-'Z'` and `'0'-'9'` (case insensitive).

  - **`condition_name`**

    A condition defined within this compound, an outer compound statement, or a system-defined error class.

  - **`SQLEXCEPTION`**

    Applies to any user-facing error condition.

  - **`NOT FOUND`**

    Applies to any error condition with a SQLSTATE ‘02’ class.

  - **`handler_action`**

    A SQL statement to execute when any of the condition values occur.
    To add multiple statements, use a nested compound statement.

- **`SQL_statement`**

  A SQL statement such as a DDL, DML, control statement, or compound statement.
  Any `SELECT` or `VALUES` statement produces a result set that the invoker can consume.

## Examples

```SQL
-- A compound statement with local variables, and exit hanlder and a nested compound.
> BEGIN
    DECLARE a INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE b INT DEFAULT 5;
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR DIVIDE_BY_ZERO
      div0: BEGIN
        VALUES (15);
      END div0;
    SET a = 10;
    SET a = b / 0;
    VALUES (a);
END;
15
```
