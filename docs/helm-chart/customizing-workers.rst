Customizing Workers
===================

Both ``CeleryExecutor`` and ``KubernetesExecutor`` workers can be highly customized with the :ref:`workers parameters <parameters:workers>`.
For example, to set resources on workers:

.. code-block:: yaml

  workers:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 1
      limits:
        cpu: 1

See :ref:`workers parameters <parameters:workers>` for a complete list.

One notable exception for ``KuberntesExecutor`` is the default anti-affinity applied to ``CeleryExecutor`` workers to spread them across nodes
is not applied to ``KubernetesExecutor`` workers, as there is no reason to spread out per-task workers.

Custom ``pod_template_file``
----------------------------

With ``KubernetesExecutor`` or ``CeleryKubernetesExecutor`` you can also provide a complete ``pod_template_file`` to configure Kubernetes workers.
This may be useful if you need different configuration between worker types for ``CeleryKubernetesExecutor``
or if you need to customize something not possible with :ref:`workers parameters <parameters:workers>` alone.

As an example, let's say you want to set ``priorityClassName`` on your workers:

.. note::

  The following example is NOT functional, but meant to be illustrative of how you can provide a custom ``pod_template_file``.
  You're better off starting with the `default pod_template_file`_ instead.

.. _default pod_template_file: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/files/pod-template-file.kubernetes-helm-yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

  podTemplate: |
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: dummy-name
      labels:
        tier: airflow
        component: worker
        release: {{ .Release.Name }}
    spec:
      priorityClassName: high-priority
      containers:
        - name: base
