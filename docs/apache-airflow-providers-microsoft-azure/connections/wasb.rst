Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Connection
=======================================

The Microsoft Azure Blob Storage connection type enables the Azure Blob Storage Integrations.

Authenticating to Azure Blob Storage
------------------------------------

There are four ways to connect to Azure Blob Storage using Airflow.

1. Use `token credentials
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-authenticate?tabs=cmd#authenticate-with-token-credentials>`_
   i.e. add specific credentials (client_id, secret, tenant) and subscription id to the Airflow connection.
2. Use `Azure Shared Key Credential
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-shared-key>`_
   i.e. add shared key credentials to the Airflow connection.
3. Use a `SAS Token
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-account-sas>`_
   i.e. add a key config directly into the Airflow connection.
4. Use a `Connection String
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/storage>`_
   i.e. add connection string to ``connection_string`` in the Airflow connection.

Only one authorization method can be used at a time. If you need to manage multiple credentials or keys then you should
configure multiple connections.

Default Connection IDs
----------------------

All hooks and operators related to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Azure FileShare Storage, and Azure Volume use ``wasp_default`` by default.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------

Login (optional)
    Specify the login used for azure blob storage. For use with Shared Key Credential and SAS Token authentication.

Password (optional)
    Specify the password used for azure blob storage. For use with
    Active Directory (token credential) and shared key authentication.

Host (optional)
    Specify the account url for anonymous public read, Active Directory, shared access key authentication.

Extra (optional)
    Specify the extra parameters (as json dictionary) that can be used in Azure connection.
    The following parameters are all optional:

    * ``tenant_id``: Specify the tenant to use. Needed for Active Directory (token) authentication.
    * ``shared_access_key``: Specify the shared access key. Needed for shared access key authentication.
    * ``connection_string``: Connection string for use with connection string authentication.
    * ``sas_token``: SAS Token for use with SAS Token authentication.

When specifying the connection in environment variable you should specify
it using URI syntax.

Note that all components of the URI should be URL-encoded.

For example connect with token credentials:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AIRFLOW_CONN_WASP_DEFAULT='wasb://blob%20username:blob%20password@myblob.com?tenant_id=tenant+id'
