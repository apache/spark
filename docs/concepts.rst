Concepts
========

Operators
'''''''''

Operators allow for generating a certain type of task on the graph. There
are 3 main type of operators:

-  **Sensor:** Waits for events to happen, it could be a file appearing
   in HDFS, the existence of a Hive partition or for an arbitrary MySQL
   query to return a row.
-  **Remote Execution:** Trigger an operation in a remote system, this
   could be a HQL statement in Hive, a Pig script, a map reduce job, a
   stored procedure in Oracle or a Bash script to run.
-  **Data transfers:** Move data from a system to another. Push data
   from Hive to MySQL, from a local file to HDFS, from Postgres to
   Oracle, or anything of that nature.

Tasks
'''''

A task represent the instantiation of an operator and becomes a node in
the directed acyclic graph (DAG). The instantiation defines specific
values when calling the abstract operator. A task could be waiting for a
specific partition in Hive, or triggering a specific DML statement in
Oracle.

Task Instances
''''''''''''''

A task instance represents a task run, for a specific point in time.
While the task defines a start datetime and a schedule (say every hour
or every day), a task instance represents a specific run of a task. A
task instance will have a status of either "started", "retrying",
"failed" or "success"

Hooks
'''''

Hooks are interfaces to external platforms and databases like Hive, S3, MySQL,
Postgres, HDFS, Pig and Cascading. Hooks implement a common interface when
possible, and act as a building block for operators. They also use 
the ``airflow.connection.Connection`` model to retrieve hostnames
and authentication information. Hooks keeps authentication code and 
information out of pipelines, centralized in the metadata database.

Hooks are also very useful on their own to use in Python scripts, 
Airflow airflow.operators.PythonOperator, and in interactive environment
like iPython or Jupyter Notebook.

Pools
'''''

Some systems can get overwhelmed when too many processes hit them at the same
time. Airflow pools can be used to **limit the execution parallelism** on 
arbitrary sets of tasks. The list of pools is managed in the UI 
(``Menu -> Admin -> Pools``) by giving the pools a name and assigning 
it a number of worker slots. Tasks can then be associated with 
one of the existing pools by using the ``pool`` parameter when 
creating tasks (instantiating operators). 

The ``pool`` parameter can
be used in conjunction with ``priority_weight`` to define priorities
in the queue, and which tasks get executed first as slots open up in the
pool. The default ``priority_weight`` is of ``1``, and can be bumped to any
number. When sorting the queue to evaluate which task should be executed 
next, we use the ``priority_weight``, summed up with of all 
the tasks ``priority_weight`` downstream from this task. This way you can
bumped a specific important task and the whole path to that task gets
prioritized accordingly.

Tasks will be scheduled as usual while the slots fill up. Once capacity is
reached, runnable tasks get queued and there state will show as such in the
UI. As slots free up, queued up tasks start running based on the 
``priority_weight`` (of the task and its descendants).

Note that by default tasks aren't assigned to any pool and their 
execution parallelism is only limited to the executor's setting.

Connections
'''''''''''

The connection information to external systems is stored in the Airflow
metadata database and managed in the UI (``Menu -> Admin -> Connections``).
A ``conn_id`` is defined there and hostname / login / password / schema 
information attached to it. Then Airflow pipelines can simply refer
to the centrally managed ``conn_id`` without having to hard code any
of this information anywhere.

Many connections with the same ``conn_id`` can be defined and when that 
is the case, and when the **hooks** uses the ``get_connection`` method 
from ``BaseHook``, Airflow will choose one connection randomly, allowing
for some basic load balancing and some fault tolerance when used in
conjunction with retries.

Queues
''''''

When using the CeleryExecutor, the celery queues that task are sent to
can be specified. ``queue`` is an attribute of BaseOperator, so any
task can be assigned to any queue. The default queue for the environment
is defined in the ``airflow.cfg``'s ``celery -> default_queue``. This defines
the queue that task get assigned to when not specified, as well as which
queue Airflow workers listen to when started.

Workers can listen to one or multiple queues of tasks. When a worker is
started (using the command ``airflow worker``), a set of comma delimited 
queue names can be specified (``airflow worker -q spark``). This worker
will then only pick up tasks wired to the specified queue(s).

This can be useful if you need specialized workers, either from a 
resource perspective (for say very lightweight tasks where one worker 
could take thousands of task without a problem), or from an environment
perspective (you want a worker running from within the Spark cluster 
itself because it needs a very specific environment and security rights).


Variables
'''''''''

Variables are a generic way to store and retrieve arbitrary content or 
settings as a simple key value store within Airflow. Variable can be 
listed, created, updated and deleted from the UI ``Admin -> Variables``
or from code. While your pipeline code definition and most of your constants
and variables should be defined in code and stored in source control,
it can be useful to have some variables or configuration items
accessible and modifiable through the UI.


.. code:: python

    from airflow.models import Variable
    foo = Variable.get("foo")
    bar = Variable.get("bar", deser_json=True)

The second call assumes ``json`` content and will be deserialized into
``bar``. Note that ``Variable`` is a sqlalchemy model and can be used 
as such.
