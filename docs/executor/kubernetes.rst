Kubernetes Executor
===================

The kubernetes executor is introduced in Apache Airflow 1.10.0. The Kubernetes executor will create a new pod for every task instance.

Example helm charts are available at ``scripts/ci/kubernetes/app/{airflow,volumes,postgres}.yaml`` in the source distribution.
The volumes are optional and depend on your configuration. There are two volumes available:

- **Dags**:

  - By storing dags onto persistent disk, it will be made available to all workers

  - Another option is to use ``git-sync``. Before starting the container, a git pull of the dags repository will be performed and used throughout the lifecycle of the pod

- **Logs**:

  - By storing logs onto a persistent disk, the files are accessible by workers and the webserver. If you don't configure this, the logs will be lost after the worker pods shuts down

  - Another option is to use S3/GCS/etc to store logs
