XComs
=====

XComs (short for "cross-communications") are a mechanism that let :doc:`tasks` talk to each other, as by default Tasks are entirely isolated and may be running on entirely different machines.

An XCom is identified by a ``key`` (essentially its name), as well as the ``task_id`` and ``dag_id`` it came from. They can have any (serializable) value, but they are only designed for small amounts of data; do not use them to pass around large values, like dataframes.

XComs are explicitly "pushed" and "pulled" to/from their storage using the ``xcom_push`` and ``xcom_pull`` methods on Task Instances. Many operators will auto-push their results into an XCom key called ``return_value`` if the ``do_xcom_push`` argument is set to ``True`` (as it is by default), and ``@task`` functions do this as well.

``xcom_pull`` defaults to using this key if no key is passed to it, meaning it's possible to write code like this::

    # Pulls the return_value XCOM from "pushing_task"
    value = task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='pushing_task')

You can also use XComs in :ref:`templates <concepts:jinja-templating>`::

    SELECT * FROM {{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='foo', key='table_name') }}

XComs are a relative of :doc:`variables`, with the main difference being that XComs are per-task-instance and designed for communication within a DAG run, while Variables are global and designed for overall configuration and value sharing.

::

  Note: If the first task run is not succeeded then on every retry task XComs will be cleared to make the task run idempotent.

Custom Backends
---------------

The XCom system has interchangeable backends, and you can set which backend is being used via the ``xcom_backend`` configuration option.

If you want to implement your own backend, you should subclass :class:`~airflow.models.xcom.BaseXCom`, and override the ``serialize_value`` and ``deserialize_value`` methods.

There is also an ``orm_deserialize_value`` method that is called whenever the XCom objects are rendered for UI or reporting purposes; if you have large or expensive-to-retrieve values in your XComs, you should override this method to avoid calling that code (and instead return a lighter, incomplete representation) so the UI remains responsive.

You can also override the ``clear`` method and use it when clearing results for given dags and tasks. This allows the custom XCom backend process the data lifecycle easier.
