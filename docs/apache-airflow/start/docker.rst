Running Airflow in Docker
#########################

This quick-start guide will allow you to quickly start Airflow with :doc:`CeleryExecutor </executor/celery>` in Docker. This is the fastest way to start Airflow.

Before you begin
================

Follow these steps to install the necessary tools.

1. Install `Docker Community Edition (CE) <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`__ on your workstation.
2. Install `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__ v1.27.0 and newer on your workstation.

Older versions of ``docker-compose`` do not support all features required by ``docker-compose.yaml`` file, so double check that it meets the minimum version requirements.

``docker-compose.yaml``
=======================

To deploy Airflow on Docker Compose, you should fetch `docker-compose.yaml <../docker-compose.yaml>`__.

.. jinja:: quick_start_ctx

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -LfO '{{ doc_root_url }}docker-compose.yaml'

This file contains several service definitions:

- ``airflow-scheduler`` - The :doc:`scheduler </scheduler>` monitors all tasks and DAGs, then triggers the
  task instances once their dependencies are complete.
- ``airflow-webserver`` - The webserver available at ``http://localhost:8080``.
- ``airflow-worker`` - The worker that executes the tasks given by the scheduler.
- ``airflow-init`` - The initialization service.
- ``flower`` - `The flower app <https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ for monitoring the environment. It is available at ``http://localhost:8080``.
- ``postgres`` - The database.
- ``redis`` - `The redis <https://redis.io/>`__ - broker that forwards messages from scheduler to worker.

All these services allow you to run Airflow with :doc:`CeleryExecutor </executor/celery>`. For more information, see :ref:`architecture`.

Some directories in the container are mounted, which means that their contents are synchronized between your computer and the container.

- ``./dags`` - you can put your DAG files here.
- ``./logs`` - contains logs from task execution and scheduler.
- ``./plugins`` - you can put your :doc:`custom plugins </plugins>` here.

Initializing Environment
========================

Before starting Airflow for the first time, You need to prepare your environment, i.e. create the necessary files, directories and initialize the database.

On **Linux**, the mounted volumes in container use the native Linux filesystem user/group permissions, so you have to make sure the container and host computer have matching file permissions.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ./dags ./logs ./plugins
    echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env

On **all operating system**, you need to run database migrations and create the first user account. To do it, run.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up airflow-init

After initialization is complete, you should see a message like below.

.. code-block:: text

    airflow-init_1       | Upgrades done
    airflow-init_1       | Admin user airflow created
    airflow-init_1       | 2.1.0.dev0
    start_airflow-init_1 exited with code 0

The account created has the login ``airflow`` and the password ``airflow``.

Running Airflow
===============

Now you can start all services:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up

In the second terminal you can check the condition of the containers and make sure that no containers are in unhealthy condition:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                              NAMES
    247ebe6cf87a   apache/airflow:master-python3.8   "/usr/bin/dumb-init …"   3 minutes ago    Up 3 minutes              8080/tcp                           compose_airflow-worker_1
    ed9b09fc84b1   apache/airflow:master-python3.8   "/usr/bin/dumb-init …"   3 minutes ago    Up 3 minutes              8080/tcp                           compose_airflow-scheduler_1

    7cb1fb603a98   apache/airflow:master-python3.8   "/usr/bin/dumb-init …"   3 minutes ago    Up 3 minutes (healthy)    0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp             compose_airflow-webserver_1
    74f3bbe506eb   postgres:13                       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   18 minutes ago   Up 17 minutes (healthy)   5432/tcp                           compose_postgres_1
    0bd6576d23cb   redis:latest                      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   10 hours ago     Up 17 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp             compose_redis_1

Accessing the environment
=========================

After starting Airflow, you can interact with it in 3 ways;

* by running :doc:`CLI commands </usage-cli>`.
* via a browser using :doc:`the web interface </ui>`.
* using :doc:`the REST API </stable-rest-api-ref>`.

Running the CLI commands
------------------------

You can also run :doc:`CLI commands </usage-cli>`, but you have to do it in one of the defined ``airflow-*`` services. For example, to run ``airflow info``, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run airflow-worker airflow info

If you have Linux or Mac OS, you can make your work easier and download a optional wrapper scripts that will allow you to run commands with a simpler command.

.. jinja:: quick_start_ctx

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -LfO '{{ doc_root_url }}airflow.sh'
        chmod +x airflow.sh

Now you can run commands easier.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./airflow.sh info

You can also use ``bash`` as parameter to enter interactive bash shell in the container or ``python`` to enter
python container.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./airflow.sh bash

.. code-block:: bash

    ./airflow.sh python

Accessing the web interface
---------------------------

Once the cluster has started up, you can log in to the web interface and try to run some tasks.

The webserver available at: ``http://localhost:8080``.
The default account has the login ``airflow`` and the password ``airflow``.

Sending requests to the REST API
--------------------------------

`Basic username password authentication <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication>`_ is currently
supported for the REST API, which means you can use common tools to send requests to the API.

The webserver available at: ``http://localhost:8080``.
The default account has the login ``airflow`` and the password ``airflow``.

Here is a sample ``curl`` command, which sends a request to retrieve a pool list:

.. code-block:: bash

    ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:8080/"
    curl -X GET  \
        --user "airflow:airflow" \
        "${ENDPOINT_URL}/api/v1/pools"


Cleaning up
===========

To stop and delete containers, delete volumes with database data and download images, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all

Notes
=====

By default, the Docker Compose file uses the latest Airflow image (`apache/airflow <https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow>`__). If you need, you can :ref:`customize and extend it <docker_image>`.

What's Next?
============

From this point, you can head to the :doc:`/tutorial` section for further examples or the :doc:`/howto/index` section if you're ready to get your hands dirty.
