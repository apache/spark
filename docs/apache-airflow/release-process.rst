Airflow's release process
=========================

Since Airflow 2.0.0 and provider packages 1.0.0 we aim to follow SemVer, meaning the release numbering works as follows:

- Versions are numbered in the form X.Y.Z.
- X is the major version number.
- Y is the minor version number, also called the *feature release* version number.
- Z is the patch number, which is incremented for bugfix and security releases.
  Before every new release, we’ll make a release candidate available, and often alpha or beta release too.
  These are of the form X.Y.Z alpha/beta/rc N, which means the Nth alpha/beta/release candidate of version X.Y.Z

In git, each minor version will have its own branch, called ``vX-Y-stable`` where bugfix/security releases will be issued from.
Commits and PRs should not normally go direct to these branches, but instead should target the main branch and then be cherry-picked by the release managers to these release branches.

Each Airflow release will also have a tag in git indicating its version number, signed with the release manager's key.
Tags for the main Airflow release have the form ``X.Y.Z`` (no leading ``v``) and provider packages are tagged with the form ``providers-<name>/X.Y.Z``.

Although Airflow follows SemVer this is not a promise of 100% compatibility between minor or patch releases, simply because this is not possible: what is a bug to one person might be a feature another person is depending on.

  Knowing the *intentions* of a maintainer can be valuable – especially *when* things break. Because that's all SemVer is: **a TL;DR of the changelog**.

That is all SemVer is -- it's a statement of our intent as package authors, and a clear statement of our goals.

    Major release
      Major releases (X.0.0, X+1.0.0 etc.) indicate a backwards-incompatible change.

      These releases do not happen with any regular interval or on any predictable schedule.

      Each time a new major version is released previously deprecated features will be removed.

    Feature releases
      Feature releases (X.Y.0, X.Y+1.0, etc.) will happen roughly every two or three months – see release process for details.
      These releases will contain new features, improvements to existing features, and such.

    Patch releases
      Patch releases (X.Y.Z, X.Y.Z+1, etc.) will happen, on an as-needed basis, as issues are reported and fixed.

      These releases will be 100% compatible with the associated feature release.
      So the answer to "should I upgrade to the latest patch release?" will always be "yes."

      The only exception to the above with respect to 100% backwards compatibility is when a security or data loss issue can’t be fixed without breaking backwards-compatibility.
      If this happens, the release notes will provide detailed upgrade instructions.
      **No new features will be added in patch releases**


Deprecation policy
==================

From time-to-time existing features will be deprecated, or modules will be renamed.

When this happens, the existing code will continue to work but will issue a DeprecationWarning (or a subclass) when the code is executed.
This code will continue to work for the rest of the current major version -- if it works on 2.0.0, it will work for every 2.Y.Z release.

So, for example, if we decided to start the deprecation of a function in Airflow 2.2.4:

* Airflow 2.2 will contain a backwards-compatible replica of the function which will raise a DeprecationWarning
* Airflow 2.3 will continue to work and issue a warning
* Airflow 3.0 (the major version that follows 2.2) will remove the feature outright

The exception to this deprecation policy is any feature which is marked as "experimental", which *may* suffer breaking changes or complete removal in a Feature release.
