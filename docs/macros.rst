Macros reference
================

Variables and macros can be used in templates (see the :ref:`jinja-templating` section)

The following come for free out of the box with Airflow.
Additional custom macros can be added globally through :ref:`plugins`, or at a DAG level through the ``DAG.user_defined_macros`` argument.

Default Variables
-----------------
The Airflow engine passes a few variables by default that are accessible
in all templates

=================================   ====================================
Variable                            Description
=================================   ====================================
``{{ ds }}``                        the execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
``{{ ds_nodash }}``                 the execution date as ``YYYYMMDD``
``{{ prev_ds }}``                   the previous execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
                                    if ``{{ ds }}`` is ``2018-01-08`` and ``schedule_interval`` is ``@weekly``,
                                    ``{{ prev_ds }}`` will be ``2018-01-01``
``{{ prev_ds_nodash }}``            the previous execution date as ``YYYYMMDD`` if exists, else ``None``
``{{ next_ds }}``                   the next execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
                                    if ``{{ ds }}`` is ``2018-01-01`` and ``schedule_interval`` is ``@weekly``,
                                    ``{{ next_ds }}`` will be ``2018-01-08``
``{{ next_ds_nodash }}``            the next execution date as ``YYYYMMDD`` if exists, else ``None``
``{{ yesterday_ds }}``              the day before the execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
``{{ yesterday_ds_nodash }}``       the day before the execution date as ``YYYYMMDD``
``{{ tomorrow_ds }}``               the day after the execution date as ``YYYY-MM-DD``
``{{ tomorrow_ds_nodash }}``        the day after the execution date as ``YYYYMMDD``
``{{ ts }}``                        same as ``execution_date.isoformat()``. Example: ``2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00``
``{{ ts_nodash }}``                 same as ``ts`` without ``-``, ``:`` and TimeZone info. Example: ``20180101T000000``
``{{ ts_nodash_with_tz }}``         same as ``ts`` without ``-`` and ``:``. Example: ``20180101T000000+0000``
``{{ execution_date }}``            the execution_date (pendulum.Pendulum)
``{{ prev_execution_date }}``       the previous execution date (if available) (pendulum.Pendulum)
``{{ next_execution_date }}``       the next execution date (pendulum.Pendulum)
``{{ dag }}``                       the DAG object
``{{ task }}``                      the Task object
``{{ macros }}``                    a reference to the macros package, described below
``{{ task_instance }}``             the task_instance object
``{{ end_date }}``                  same as ``{{ ds }}``
``{{ latest_date }}``               same as ``{{ ds }}``
``{{ ti }}``                        same as ``{{ task_instance }}``
``{{ params }}``                    a reference to the user-defined params dictionary which can be overridden by
                                    the dictionary passed through ``trigger_dag -c`` if you enabled
                                    ``dag_run_conf_overrides_params` in ``airflow.cfg``
``{{ var.value.my_var }}``          global defined variables represented as a dictionary
``{{ var.json.my_var.path }}``      global defined variables represented as a dictionary
                                    with deserialized JSON object, append the path to the
                                    key within the JSON object
``{{ task_instance_key_str }}``     a unique, human-readable key to the task instance
                                    formatted ``{dag_id}_{task_id}_{ds}``
``{{ conf }}``                      the full configuration object located at
                                    ``airflow.configuration.conf`` which
                                    represents the content of your
                                    ``airflow.cfg``
``{{ run_id }}``                    the ``run_id`` of the current DAG run
``{{ dag_run }}``                   a reference to the DagRun object
``{{ test_mode }}``                 whether the task instance was called using
                                    the CLI's test subcommand
=================================   ====================================

Note that you can access the object's attributes and methods with simple
dot notation. Here are some examples of what is possible:
``{{ task.owner }}``, ``{{ task.task_id }}``, ``{{ ti.hostname }}``, ...
Refer to the models documentation for more information on the objects'
attributes and methods.

The ``var`` template variable allows you to access variables defined in Airflow's
UI. You can access them as either plain-text or JSON. If you use JSON, you are
also able to walk nested structures, such as dictionaries like:
``{{ var.json.my_dict_var.key1 }}``

Macros
------
Macros are a way to expose objects to your templates and live under the
``macros`` namespace in your templates.

A few commonly used libraries and methods are made available.


=================================   ==============================================
Variable                            Description
=================================   ==============================================
``macros.datetime``                 The standard lib's :class:`datetime.datetime`
``macros.timedelta``                The standard lib's :class:`datetime.datetime`
``macros.dateutil``                 A reference to the ``dateutil`` package
``macros.time``                     The standard lib's :class:`datetime.time`
``macros.uuid``                     The standard lib's :mod:`uuid`
``macros.random``                   The standard lib's :mod:`random`
=================================   ==============================================


Some airflow specific macros are also defined:

.. automodule:: airflow.macros
    :show-inheritance:
    :members:

.. autofunction:: airflow.macros.hive.closest_ds_partition
.. autofunction:: airflow.macros.hive.max_partition
