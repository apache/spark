[SQLSTATE: 42K0D](sql-error-conditions-sqlstates.html#class-42-syntax-error-or-access-rule-violation)

Invalid lambda function call.

This error class has the following derived error classes:

## DUPLICATE_ARG_NAMES

The lambda function has duplicate arguments `<args>`. Please, consider to rename the argument names or set `<caseSensitiveConfig>` to "true".

## NON_HIGHER_ORDER_FUNCTION

A lambda function should only be used in a higher order function. However, its class is `<class>`, which is not a higher order function.

## NUM_ARGS_MISMATCH

A higher order function expects `<expectedNumArgs>` arguments, but got `<actualNumArgs>`.
