This error class has the following derived error classes:

## ACCESSING_OUTER_QUERY_COLUMN_IS_NOT_ALLOWED

Accessing outer query column is not allowed in this location`<treeNode>`.

## AGGREGATE_FUNCTION_MIXED_OUTER_LOCAL_REFERENCES

Found an aggregate function in a correlated predicate that has both outer and local references, which is not supported: `<function>`.

## CORRELATED_COLUMN_IS_NOT_ALLOWED_IN_PREDICATE

Correlated column is not allowed in predicate: `<treeNode>`.

## CORRELATED_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND

A correlated outer name reference within a subquery expression body was not found in the enclosing query: `<value>`.

## CORRELATED_REFERENCE

Expressions referencing the outer query are not supported outside of WHERE/HAVING clauses: `<sqlExprs>`.

## LATERAL_JOIN_CONDITION_NON_DETERMINISTIC

Lateral join condition cannot be non-deterministic: `<condition>`.

## MUST_AGGREGATE_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY

## NON_CORRELATED_COLUMNS_IN_GROUP_BY

A GROUP BY clause in a scalar correlated subquery cannot contain non-correlated columns: `<value>`.

## NON_DETERMINISTIC_LATERAL_SUBQUERIES

Non-deterministic lateral subqueries are not supported when joining with outer relations that produce more than one row`<treeNode>`.

## UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_REFERENCE_DATA_TYPE

Correlated column reference '`<expr>`' cannot be `<dataType>` type.

## UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_SCALAR_SUBQUERY
