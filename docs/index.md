# Downloading

Get Spark from the [downloads page](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) of the project website. This documentation is for Spark version {{site.SPARK_VERSION}}. Spark uses Hadoop's client libraries for HDFS and YARN. Downloads are pre-packaged for a handful of popular Hadoop versions.
Users can also download a "Hadoop free" binary and run Spark with any Hadoop version
[by augmenting Spark's classpath](hadoop-provided.html).
Scala and Java users can include Spark in their projects using its Maven coordinates and Python users can install Spark from PyPI.


If you'd like to build Spark from
source, visit [Building Spark](building-spark.html).


Spark runs on both Windows and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS), and it should run on any platform that runs a supported version of Java. This should include JVMs on x86_64 and ARM64. It's easy to run locally on one machine --- all you need is to have `java` installed on your system `PATH`, or the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to a Java installation.

Spark runs on Java 17/21, Scala 2.13, Python 3.9+, and R 3.5+ (Deprecated).
When using the Scala API, it is necessary for applications to use the same version of Scala that Spark was compiled for. Since Spark 4.0.0, it's Scala 2.13.

# Running the Examples and Shell

Spark comes with several sample programs. Python, Scala, Java, and R examples are in the
`examples/src/main` directory.

To run Spark interactively in a Python interpreter, use
`bin/pyspark`:

    ./bin/pyspark --master "local[2]"

Sample applications are provided in Python. For example:

    ./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/python/pi.py 10

To run one of the Scala or Java sample programs, use
`bin/run-example <class> [params]` in the top-level Spark directory. (Behind the scenes, this
invokes the more general
[`spark-submit` script](submitting-applications.html) for
launching applications). For example,

    ./bin/run-example SparkPi 10

You can also run Spark interactively through a modified version of the Scala shell. This is a
great way to learn the framework.

    ./bin/spark-shell --master "local[2]"

The `--master` option specifies the
[master URL for a distributed cluster](submitting-applications.html#master-urls), or `local` to run
locally with one thread, or `local[N]` to run locally with N threads. You should start by using
`local` for testing. For a full list of options, run the Spark shell with the `--help` option.

Since version 1.4, Spark has provided an [R API](sparkr.html) (only the DataFrame APIs are included).
To run Spark interactively in an R interpreter, use `bin/sparkR`:

    ./bin/sparkR --master "local[2]"

Example applications are also provided in R. For example:

    ./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/r/dataframe.R

## Running Spark Client Applications Anywhere with Spark Connect

Spark Connect is a new client-server architecture introduced in Spark 3.4 that decouples Spark
client applications and allows remote connectivity to Spark clusters. The separation between
client and server allows Spark and its open ecosystem to be leveraged from anywhere, embedded
in any application. In Spark 3.4, Spark Connect provides DataFrame API coverage for PySpark and
DataFrame/Dataset API support in Scala.

To learn more about Spark Connect and how to use it, see [Spark Connect Overview](spark-connect-overview.html).

# Launching on a Cluster

The Spark [cluster mode overview](cluster-overview.html) explains the key concepts in running on a cluster.
Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several
options for deployment:

* [Standalone Deploy Mode](spark-standalone.html): simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
* [Hadoop YARN](running-on-yarn.html)
* [Kubernetes](running-on-kubernetes.html)
