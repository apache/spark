# Notes:
#  Based on http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578272-topological-sort
#   with these major changes:
#    Added unittests.
#    Deleted doctests (maybe not the best idea in the world, but it cleans
#     up the docstring).
#    Moved functools import to the top of the file.
#    Changed assert to a ValueError.
#    Changed iter[items|keys] to [items|keys], for python 3
#     compatibility.
#    Copy the input so as to leave it unmodified.
#    Renamed function from toposort2 to toposort.
#    Handle empty input.
#    Switch tests to use set literals.
