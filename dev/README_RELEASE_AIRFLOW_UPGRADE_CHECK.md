You can find the prerequisites to release Apache Airflow in [README.md](README.md). This document
details the steps for releasing apache-airflow-upgrade-check package.

# Prepare the Apache Airflow Upgrade Check Package RC

## Pre-requisites

- Install `setuptools-build-subpackage` by running:

  ```shell script
  pip install setuptools-build-subpackage
  ```

## Build RC artifacts

The Release Candidate artifacts we vote upon should be the exact ones we vote against,
without any modification than renaming – i.e. the contents of the files must be
the same between voted release candidate and final release.
Because of this the version in the built artifacts that will become the
official Apache releases must not include the rcN suffix.

- Set environment variables

    ```shell script
    # Set Version
    export VERSION=1.3.0rc1


    # Set AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT to the path of your git repo
    export AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT=$(pwd)


    # Example after cloning
    git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow.git airflow
    cd airflow
    export AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT=$(pwd)
    ```

- Checkout `v1-10-stable` branch:

    ```shell script
    git checkout v1-10-stable
    ```

- Set your version to 1.3.0 in `airflow/upgrade/version.py` (without the RC tag)
- Commit the version change.

- Tag your release

    ```shell script
    git tag -s upgrade-check/${VERSION}
    ```

- Clean the checkout: the sdist step below will

    ```shell script
    git clean -fxd
    ```

- Tarball the repo

    ```shell script
    git archive upgrade-check/${VERSION} --prefix=apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION%rc?}/ \
        -o apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz \
        airflow/upgrade NOTICE LICENSE licenses/ .rat-excludes
    ```

- Generate sdist

    NOTE: Make sure your checkout is clean at this stage - any untracked or changed files will otherwise be included
     in the file produced.

    ```shell script
    python -m setuptools_build_subpackage --subpackage-folder airflow/upgrade \
        sdist --license-template ./LICENSE bdist_wheel
    ```

- Rename the sdist

    ```shell script
    mv dist/apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION%rc?}.tar.gz apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION}.tar.gz
    mv dist/apache_airflow_upgrade_check-${VERSION%rc?}-py2.py3-none-any.whl apache_airflow_upgrade_check-${VERSION}-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    ```

- Generate SHA512/ASC (If you have not generated a key yet, generate it by following instructions on
  http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#key-gen-generate-key)

    ```shell script
    ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dev/sign.sh apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION}-source.tar.gz
    ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dev/sign.sh apache-airflow-upgrade-check-${VERSION}.tar.gz
    ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dev/sign.sh apache_airflow_upgrade_check-${VERSION}-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    ```

- Push the artifacts to ASF dev dist repo

  ```shell script
  # First clone the repo
  svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow airflow-dev

  # Create new folder for the release
  cd airflow-dev/upgrade-check
  svn mkdir ${VERSION}

  # Move the artifacts to svn folder & commit
  mv ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/apache{-,_}airflow*-${VERSION}* ${VERSION}/
  cd ${VERSION}
  svn add *
  svn commit -m "Add artifacts for Upgrade Check ${VERSION}"
  ```

## Prepare PyPI convenience "snapshot" packages

At this point we have the artefact that we vote on, but as a convenience to developers we also want to
publish "snapshots" of the RC builds to pypi for installing via pip.

To do this we need to

- Build the package:

    ```shell script
    cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
    python -m setuptools_build_subpackage --subpackage-folder airflow/upgrade \
        egg_info --tag-build "$(sed -e "s/^[0-9.]*//" <<<"$VERSION")" sdist \
        --license-template ./LICENSE bdist_wheel
    ```

- Verify the artifacts that would be uploaded:

    ```shell script
    twine check dist/*
    ```

- Upload the package to PyPi's test environment:

    ```shell script
    twine upload -r pypitest dist/*
    ```

- Verify that the test package looks good by downloading it and installing it into a virtual environment.
  The package download link is available at: https://test.pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-upgrade-check/#history

- Upload the package to PyPi's production environment:

  ```shell script
  twine upload -r pypi dist/*
  ```

- Again, confirm that the package is available here: https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-upgrade-check

It is important to stress that this snapshot should not be named "release", and it
is not supposed to be used by and advertised to the end-users who do not read the devlist.

- Push Tag for the release candidate

    ```shell script
    git push origin upgrade-check/${VERSION}
    ```

## Prepare Vote email on the Apache Airflow release candidate

- Send out a vote to the dev@airflow.apache.org mailing list:

Subject:

```
[VOTE] Release apache-airflow-upgrade-check 1.3.0 from 1.3.0rc1
```

Body:

```
Hey all,

This calls for the release of a new dist: apache-airflow-upgrade-check,
version 1.3.0. This represents the contents of the airflow/upgrade/
tree (plus a few supporting files) as a separate dist.

This code is based on the v1-10-stable branch, the git tag is https://github.com/apache/airflow/releases/tag/upgrade-check%2F1.3.0rc1

This email is calling a vote on the release, which will last until Friday 12th February 23:40 UTC

Consider this my (binding) +1.

The files can be downloaded from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/upgrade-check/1.3.0rc1/

- apache-airflow-upgrade-check-1.3.0rc1-source.tar.gz is a source
release containing the files that made up the binary and wheel
releases.
- apache-airflow-upgrade-check-1.3.0rc1.tar.gz is the binary
Python "sdist" release.
- apache_airflow_upgrade_check-1.3.0rc1-py2.py3-none-any.whl is the
binary Python pre-compiled wheel file.

Public keys are available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS

This dist is also available on PyPI
https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-upgrade-check/

Changelog: https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/upgrade-check/1.3.0rc1/airflow/upgrade#changelog

Only votes from PMC members are binding, but members of the community
to test the release and vote with "(non-binding)".

The test procedure for PMCs and Contributors who would like to test
this RC are described in
<https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/README_RELEASE_AIRFLOW.md#verify-release-candidates-by-contributors>,
but again, this time it is a little bit different.

To actually use this command you will need apache-airflow 1.10.15

Please note that the version number inside the archives exclude the
`rcX` string, so it's now simply 1.3.0. This will allow us to rename
the artifact without modifying the artifact checksums when we actually
release.

Thanks,
<your name>
```


# Verify the release candidate by PMCs

The PMCs should verify the releases in order to make sure the release is following the
[Apache Legal Release Policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html).

At least 3 (+1) votes should be recorded in accordance to
[Votes on Package Releases](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#ReleaseVotes)

The legal checks include:

* checking if the packages are present in the right dist folder on svn
* verifying if all the sources have correct licences
* verifying if release manager signed the releases with the right key
* verifying if all the checksums are valid for the release

## SVN check

The files should be present in the sub-folder of
[Airflow dist](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/)

The following files should be present (9 files):

* -source.tar.gz + .asc + .sha512
* .tar.gz + .asc + .sha512
* -py3-none-any.whl + .asc + .sha512

As a PMC you should be able to clone the SVN repository:

```shell script
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow
```

Or update it if you already checked it out:

```shell script
svn update .
```

## Licence check

This can be done with the Apache RAT tool.

* Download the latest jar from https://creadur.apache.org/rat/download_rat.cgi (unpack the binary,
  the jar is inside)
* Unpack the binary (`-bin.tar.gz`) to a folder
* Enter the folder and run the check (point to the place where you extracted the .jar)

```shell script
java -jar ../../apache-rat-0.13/apache-rat-0.13.jar -E .rat-excludes -d .
```

where `.rat-excludes` is the file in the root of Airflow source code.

## Signature check

Make sure you have the key of person signed imported in your GPG. You can find the valid keys in
[KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS).

You can import the whole KEYS file:

```shell script
gpg --import KEYS
```

You can also import the keys individually from a keyserver. The below one uses Kaxil's key and
retrieves it from the default GPG keyserver
[OpenPGP.org](https://keys.openpgp.org):

```shell script
gpg --receive-keys 12717556040EEF2EEAF1B9C275FCCD0A25FA0E4B
```

You should choose to import the key when asked.

Note that by being default, the OpenPGP server tends to be overloaded often and might respond with
errors or timeouts. Many of the release managers also uploaded their keys to the
[GNUPG.net](https://keys.gnupg.net) keyserver, and you can retrieve it from there.

```shell script
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --receive-keys 12717556040EEF2EEAF1B9C275FCCD0A25FA0E4B
```

Once you have the keys, the signatures can be verified by running this:

```shell script
for i in *.asc
do
   echo "Checking $i"; gpg --verify $i
done
```

This should produce results similar to the below. The "Good signature from ..." is indication
that the signatures are correct. Do not worry about the "not certified with a trusted signature"
warning. Most of the certificates used by release managers are self signed, that's why you get this
warning. By importing the server in the previous step and importing it via ID from
[KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS) page, you know that
this is a valid Key already.

```

## SHA512 sum check

Run this:

```shell script
for i in *.sha512
do
    echo "Checking $i"; shasum -a 512 `basename $i .sha512 ` | diff - $i
done
```

You should get output similar to:

```
Checking apache-airflow-upgrade-check-1.3.0rc1.tar.gz.sha512
Checking apache_airflow_upgrade_check-1.3.0rc1-py2.py3-none-any.whl.sha512
Checking apache-airflow-upgrade-check-1.3.0rc1-source.tar.gz.sha512
```

# Verify release candidates by Contributors

This can be done (and we encourage to) by any of the Contributors. In fact, it's best if the
actual users of Apache Airflow test it in their own staging/test installations. Each release candidate
is available on PyPI apart from SVN packages, so everyone should be able to install
the release candidate version of Airflow Upgrade Check via simply (<VERSION> is 1.3.0
for example, and <X> is release candidate number 1,2,3,....).

```shell script
pip install apache-airflow-upgrade-check==<VERSION>rc<X>
```

Once this is installed, please run the upgrade check script.

```shell script
airflow upgrade_check
```

You should see an output like the following:

```shell script
========================================= STATUS =========================================

Check for latest versions of apache-airflow and checker...........................SUCCESS
Remove airflow.AirflowMacroPlugin class...........................................SUCCESS
Ensure users are not using custom metaclasses in custom operators.................SUCCESS

```

You can then perform any other verifications to check that the it works as you expected.

# Publish the final release

## Publish release to SVN

You need to migrate the RC artifacts that passed to this repository:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/upgrade-check/
(The migration should include renaming the files so that they no longer have the RC number in their filenames.)

The best way of doing this is to svn cp between the two repos (this avoids having to upload
the binaries again, and gives a clearer history in the svn commit logs):

```shell script
# First clone the repo
export RC=1.3.0rc1
export VERSION=${RC/rc?/}
svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow airflow-release

# Create new folder for the release
cd airflow-release/upgrade-check
svn mkdir ${VERSION}
cd ${VERSION}

# Move the artifacts to svn folder & commit
for f in ../../../airflow-dev/upgrade-check/$RC/*; do svn cp $f ${$(basename $f)/rc?/}; done
svn commit -m "Release Airflow Upgrade Check ${VERSION} from ${RC}"

# Remove old release
# http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#when-to-archive
cd ..
export PREVIOUS_VERSION=1.2.0
svn rm ${PREVIOUS_VERSION}
svn commit -m "Remove old Upgrade Check release: ${PREVIOUS_VERSION}"
```

Verify that the packages appear in [airflow upgrade check](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/upgrade-check/)

## Prepare PyPI "release" packages

At this point we release an official package:

- Checkout the tag:

    ```shell script
    git checkout upgrade-check/${RC}
    ```

- Build the package:

    ```shell script
    cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
    git clean -fxd
    python -m setuptools_build_subpackage --subpackage-folder airflow/upgrade \
        sdist --license-template ./LICENSE bdist_wheel
    ```

- Verify the artifacts that would be uploaded:

    ```shell script
    twine check dist/*
    ```

- Upload the package to PyPi's test environment:

    ```shell script
    twine upload -r pypitest dist/*
    ```

- Verify that the package looks good by downloading it and installing it into a virtual environment.
    The package download link is available at: https://test.pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-upgrade-check/#files

- Upload the package to PyPi's production environment:

    ```shell script
    twine upload -r pypi dist/*
    ```

- Again, confirm that the package is available here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-airflow-upgrade-check

- Push Tag for the final version

    ```shell script
    git tag -s "upgrade-check/${VERSION}"
    git push origin "upgrade-check/${VERSION}"
    ```

## Notify developers of release

- Notify users@airflow.apache.org (cc'ing dev@airflow.apache.org and announce@apache.org) that
the artifacts have been published:

Subject:

```shell script
cat <<EOF
[ANNOUNCE] Apache Airflow Upgrade Check 1.3.0 released
