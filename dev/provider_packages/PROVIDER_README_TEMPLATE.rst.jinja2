Provider package
================

This is a provider package for ``{{PROVIDER_PACKAGE_ID}}`` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in ``{{FULL_PACKAGE_NAME}}`` python package.

You can find package information and changelog for the provider
in the `documentation <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/{{ PACKAGE_PIP_NAME }}/{{RELEASE}}/>`_.


Installation
============

NOTE!

On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might lead to errors in installation - depends on your choice
of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
``pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4`` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
``--use-deprecated legacy-resolver`` to your pip install command.

You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
``pip install {{PACKAGE_PIP_NAME}}``

Cross provider package dependencies

You need to install the specified provider packages in order to use them.

You can install such cross-provider dependencies when installing from PyPI. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install {{ PACKAGE_PIP_NAME }}[{{ CROSS_PROVIDERS_DEPENDENCIES[0] }}]
