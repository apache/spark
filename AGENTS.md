# Apache Spark

## Pre-flight Checks

Before the first code read, edit, or test in a session, ensure a clean working environment. DO NOT skip these checks:

1. Run `git remote -v` to identify the personal fork and upstream (`apache/spark`). If unclear, ask the user to configure their remotes following the standard convention (`origin` for the fork, `upstream` for `apache/spark`).
2. If the latest commit on `<upstream>/master` is more than a day old (check with `git log -1 --format="%ci" <upstream>/master`), run `git fetch <upstream> master`.
3. If there are uncommitted changes (check with `git status`), ask the user to stash them before proceeding.
4. Switch to the appropriate branch:
   - **Existing PR**: look for a local branch matching the PR branch name. If found, switch to it and inform the user. If not found, ask whether to fetch it or if there is a local branch under a different name.
   - **New edits**: ask the user to choose: create a new git worktree from `<upstream>/master` and work from there (recommended), or create and switch to a new branch from `<upstream>/master`.
   - **Reading code or running tests**: use `<upstream>/master`.

## Development Notes

SQL golden file tests are managed by `SQLQueryTestSuite` and its variants. Read the class documentation before running or updating these tests. DO NOT edit the generated golden files (`.sql.out`) directly. Always regenerate them when needed, and carefully review the diff to make sure it's expected.

Spark Connect protocol is defined in proto files under `sql/connect/common/src/main/protobuf/`. Read the README there before modifying proto definitions.

## Build and Test

Build and tests can take a long time. Before running tests, ask the user if they have more changes to make.

Prefer SBT over Maven for faster incremental compilation. Module names are defined in `project/SparkBuild.scala`.

Compile a single module:

    build/sbt <module>/compile

Compile test code for a single module:

    build/sbt <module>/Test/compile

Run test suites by wildcard or full class name:

    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly *MySuite'
    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.MySuite'

Run test cases matching a substring:

    build/sbt '<module>/testOnly *MySuite -- -z "test name"'

For faster iteration, keep SBT open in interactive mode:

    build/sbt
    > project <module>
    > testOnly *MySuite

### PySpark Tests

PySpark tests require building Spark with Hive support first:

    build/sbt -Phive package

Activate the virtual environment specified by the user, or default to `.venv`:

    source <venv>/bin/activate

If the default venv does not exist, create it:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r dev/requirements.txt

Run a single test suite:

    python/run-tests --testnames pyspark.sql.tests.arrow.test_arrow

Run a single test case:

    python/run-tests --testnames "pyspark.sql.tests.test_catalog CatalogTests.test_current_database"

## Pull Request Workflow

PR title requires a JIRA ticket ID (e.g., `[SPARK-xxxx][SQL] Title`). Ask the user to create a new ticket or provide an existing one if not given. Follow the template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` for the PR description.

DO NOT push to the upstream repo. Always push to the personal fork. Open PRs against `master` on the upstream repo.

DO NOT force push or use `--amend` on pushed commits unless the user explicitly asks. If the remote branch has new commits, fetch and rebase before pushing.

Always get user approval before external operations such as pushing commits, creating PRs, or posting comments. Use `gh pr create` to open PRs. If `gh` is not installed, generate the GitHub PR URL for the user and recommend installing the GitHub CLI.
