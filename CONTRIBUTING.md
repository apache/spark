Contributing to Spark

Before opening a pull request, please review the Contributing to Spark guide. It outlines the steps that are required before creating a pull request (PR). In particular, consider the following:

    Is the change important and ready enough to ask the community to spend time reviewing?

    Have you searched for existing, related JIRAs and pull requests?

    Is this a new feature that can stand alone as a third-party project?

    Is the change being proposed clearly explained and motivated?
