/**
 * :: DeveloperApi ::
 *
 * A base interface to help user extend custom feature step in driver side.
 * Note: If your custom feature step would be used only in driver or both in driver and executor,
 * please use this.
 *
 * Example of driver feature step:
 *
 * {{{
 *   class DriverExampleFeatureStep extends KubernetesDriverCustomFeatureConfigStep {
 *     private var driverConf: KubernetesDriverConf = _
 *
 *     override def init(conf: KubernetesDriverConf): Unit = {
 *       driverConf = conf
 *     }
 *
 *     // Implements methods of `KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`, such as `configurePod`
 *     override def configurePod(pod: SparkPod): SparkPod = {
 *       // Apply modifications on the given pod in accordance to this feature.
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * Example of feature step for both driver and executor:
 *
 * {{{
 *   class DriverAndExecutorExampleFeatureStep extends KubernetesDriverCustomFeatureConfigStep
 *     with KubernetesExecutorCustomFeatureConfigStep {
 *     private var kubernetesConf: KubernetesConf = _
 *
 *     override def init(conf: KubernetesDriverConf): Unit = {
 *       kubernetesConf = conf
 *     }
 *
 *     override def init(conf: KubernetesExecutorConf): Unit = {
 *       kubernetesConf = conf
 *     }
 *
 *     // Implements methods of `KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`, such as `configurePod`
 *     override def configurePod(pod: SparkPod): SparkPod = {
 *       // Apply modifications on the given pod in accordance to this feature.
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
