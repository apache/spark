  /**
   * Run static Label Propagation for detecting communities in networks.
   *
   * Each node in the network is initially assigned to its own community. At every superstep, nodes
   * send their community affiliation to all neighbors and update their state to the mode community
   * affiliation of incoming messages.
   *
   * LPA is a standard community detection algorithm for graphs. It is very inexpensive
   * computationally, although (1) convergence is not guaranteed and (2) one can end up with
   * trivial solutions (all nodes are identified into a single community).
   *
   * @tparam ED the edge attribute type (not used in the computation)
   *
   * @param graph the graph for which to compute the community affiliation
   * @param maxSteps the number of supersteps of LPA to be performed. Because this is a static
   * implementation, the algorithm will run for exactly this many supersteps.
   *
   * @return a graph with vertex attributes containing the label of community affiliation
