/**
 * `libsvm` package implements Spark SQL data source API for loading LIBSVM data as [[DataFrame]].
 * The loaded [[DataFrame]] has two columns: `label` containing labels stored as doubles and
 * `features` containing feature vectors stored as [[Vector]]s.
 *
 * To use LIBSVM data source, you need to set "libsvm" as the format in [[DataFrameReader]] and
 * optionally specify options, for example:
 * {{{
 *   // Scala
 *   val df = spark.read.format("libsvm")
 *     .option("numFeatures", "780")
 *     .load("data/mllib/sample_libsvm_data.txt")
 *
 *   // Java
 *   Dataset<Row> df = spark.read().format("libsvm")
 *     .option("numFeatures, "780")
 *     .load("data/mllib/sample_libsvm_data.txt");
 * }}}
 *
 * LIBSVM data source supports the following options:
 *  - "numFeatures": number of features.
 *    If unspecified or nonpositive, the number of features will be determined automatically at the
 *    cost of one additional pass.
 *    This is also useful when the dataset is already split into multiple files and you want to load
 *    them separately, because some features may not present in certain files, which leads to
 *    inconsistent feature dimensions.
 *  - "vectorType": feature vector type, "sparse" (default) or "dense".
 *
 * Note that this class is public for documentation purpose. Please don't use this class directly.
 * Rather, use the data source API as illustrated above.
