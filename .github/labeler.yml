# Pull Request Labeler Github Action Configuration: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/labeler
#
# Note that we currently cannot use the negatioon operator  (i.e. `!`)  for miniglob matches as they
# would match any file that doesn't touch them. What's needed is the concept of `any `, which takes a
# list of constraints / globs and then matches all of the constraints for either `any` of the files or
# `all` of the files in the change set.
#
# However, `any`/`all` are not supported in a released version and testing off of the `main` branch
# resulted in some other errors when testing.
#
# An issue has been opened upstream requesting that a release be cut that has support for all/any:
#   - https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/111
#
# While we wait for this issue to be handled upstream, we can remove
# the negated / `!` matches for now and at least have labels again.
