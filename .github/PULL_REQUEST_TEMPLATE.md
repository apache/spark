Per Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).

Testing Done:
- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please
specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our
coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.

* Your PR's title must reference an issue on 
[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). 
For example, a PR called "[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR" would close JIRA
